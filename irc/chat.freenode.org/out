2015-01-13 00:17 - The servers in question have been removed from the network and
2015-01-13 00:17 - shut down.  However, it's possible that network traffic  -

2015-01-13 00:21 - VERNE, Jules (1828-1905). Born in Nantes, France, Verne was
2015-01-13 00:21 - a pioneering french author known for novels such as Twenty
2015-01-13 00:21 - Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, A Journey to the Center of the
2015-01-13 00:21 - Earth, and Around the World in Eighty Days. Often lauded as the
2015-01-13 00:21 - Father of science fiction, Verne wrote about concepts such as
2015-01-13 00:21 - space travel, skyscrapers, and worldwide communications
2015-01-13 00:21 - networks long before these ideas became popularised or realised.

2015-01-13 00:55 - Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, A Journey to the Center of the

2015-01-27 00:39 -  
2015-01-27 00:39 - Over the weekend of 13th-14th September freenode staff noticed
2015-01-27 00:39 - some compromised binaries present on a number of servers. 
2015-01-27 00:39 - The servers in question have been removed from the network and
2015-01-27 00:39 - shut down.  However, it's possible that network traffic  -
2015-01-27 00:39 - including SSL traffic - has been sniffed and passwords
2015-01-27 00:39 - exposed.
2015-01-27 00:39 -  
2015-01-27 00:39 - We therefore recommend that all users change their nickserv 
2015-01-27 00:39 - password(s) to a new value which is not shared with any
2015-01-27 00:39 - other service.
2015-01-27 00:39 -  
2015-01-27 00:39 - You can do this with /msg nickserv set password newpasshere
2015-01-27 00:39 -  
2015-01-27 00:39 - Please note that investigation is ongoing to discover the root
2015-01-27 00:39 - cause of the attack, and until this investigation is complete
2015-01-27 00:39 - we cannot be 100% certain that all traces of the compromises 
2015-01-27 00:39 - have been removed. We may have to ask you to change your  
2015-01-27 00:39 - passwords again after analysis has completed.

2015-02-03 03:23 -                       SECURITY ALERT
2015-02-03 03:23 -  
2015-02-03 03:23 - Over the weekend of 13th-14th September freenode staff noticed
2015-02-03 03:23 - some compromised binaries present on a number of servers. 
2015-02-03 03:23 - The servers in question have been removed from the network and
2015-02-03 03:23 - shut down.  However, it's possible that network traffic  -
2015-02-03 03:23 - including SSL traffic - has been sniffed and passwords
2015-02-03 03:23 - exposed.
2015-02-03 03:23 -  
2015-02-03 03:23 - We therefore recommend that all users change their nickserv 
2015-02-03 03:23 - password(s) to a new value which is not shared with any
2015-02-03 03:23 - other service.
2015-02-03 03:23 -  
2015-02-03 03:23 - You can do this with /msg nickserv set password newpasshere
2015-02-03 03:23 -  
2015-02-03 03:23 - Please note that investigation is ongoing to discover the root
2015-02-03 03:23 - cause of the attack, and until this investigation is complete
2015-02-03 03:23 - we cannot be 100% certain that all traces of the compromises 
2015-02-03 03:23 - have been removed. We may have to ask you to change your  
2015-02-03 03:23 - passwords again after analysis has completed.
2015-02-03 03:23 -  
2015-02-03 03:23 - Further details will appear on https://blog.freenode.net/

2015-02-04 23:14 -  
2015-02-04 23:14 - Over the weekend of 13th-14th September freenode staff noticed
2015-02-04 23:14 - some compromised binaries present on a number of servers. 
2015-02-04 23:14 - The servers in question have been removed from the network and
2015-02-04 23:14 - shut down.  However, it's possible that network traffic  -
2015-02-04 23:14 - including SSL traffic - has been sniffed and passwords
2015-02-04 23:14 - exposed.
2015-02-04 23:14 -  
2015-02-04 23:14 - We therefore recommend that all users change their nickserv 
2015-02-04 23:14 - password(s) to a new value which is not shared with any
2015-02-04 23:14 - other service.
2015-02-04 23:14 -  
2015-02-04 23:14 - You can do this with /msg nickserv set password newpasshere
2015-02-04 23:14 -  
2015-02-04 23:14 - Please note that investigation is ongoing to discover the root
2015-02-04 23:14 - cause of the attack, and until this investigation is complete
2015-02-04 23:14 - we cannot be 100% certain that all traces of the compromises 
2015-02-04 23:14 - have been removed. We may have to ask you to change your  
2015-02-04 23:14 - passwords again after analysis has completed.

2015-02-10 02:00 - The servers in question have been removed from the network and
2015-02-10 02:00 - shut down.  However, it's possible that network traffic  -

2015-02-10 02:00 - Please note that investigation is ongoing to discover the root
2015-02-10 02:00 - cause of the attack, and until this investigation is complete
2015-02-10 02:00 - we cannot be 100% certain that all traces of the compromises 
2015-02-10 02:00 - have been removed. We may have to ask you to change your  
2015-02-10 02:00 - passwords again after analysis has completed.
