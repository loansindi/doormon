2015-01-13 00:56 <loans> doormon is alive

2015-01-13 00:56 <hef1> why 2 service files?

2015-01-13 00:58 <loans> so the problem was
2015-01-13 00:58 <loans> when i had an ExecStartPost=/srv/doormon/bot.sh
2015-01-13 00:58 <loans> for some reason it would sit there waiting for the inotifywait in the script to finish

2015-01-13 00:59 <hef1> it's an ii script?
2015-01-13 00:59 <loans> bot.sh is bash/awk

2015-01-13 01:01 <hef1> ah
2015-01-13 01:01 <hef1> so instead it jumps across 3 languages?
2015-01-13 01:01 <hef1> ii, awk, bash

2015-01-13 05:00 <DoormanDave> the extra 3 bucks is totally worth it
2015-01-13 05:00 <`justin> which doesn't give me a lot of confidence...

2015-01-13 05:00 <DoormanDave> but no, it was good enough that I'm craving more
2015-01-13 05:01 <DoormanDave> and I've had so much little caesars in my life I never thought I'd crave it.

2015-01-13 15:56 <sylphiae> i do feel like there's an image problem with the board, or else most of our 300+ members don't have the foggiest of what it does
2015-01-13 15:57 <loans> that's an extant issue that likely won't be going away anytime soon since most of our membership also probably doesn't care

2015-01-13 16:10 <Toba> that's not that bad reporting

2015-01-13 16:43 <DoormanDave> i'm dogsitting two whiny terriers
2015-01-13 16:43 <skay> If I am elected I threaten to work my cat from the space
2015-01-13 16:44 <asl2> can a cat work at all?
2015-01-13 16:44 <NegativeK> Work your cat?
2015-01-13 16:44 <skay> verb it somehow
2015-01-13 16:44 <skay> it's only a threat so does the verb really matter?
2015-01-13 16:44 <skay> if I am elected I will have a table amnesty day
2015-01-13 16:44 <skay> CarlFK: ^

2015-01-13 16:45 <DoormanDave> I nominate Sprongy for VP
2015-01-13 16:45 <skay> agocs: were you around when CarlFK brought 20 tables to the space?
2015-01-13 16:45 <agocs> No, I do not think so
2015-01-13 16:45 <NegativeK> Tablepocalypse.
2015-01-13 16:45 <DoormanDave> why so many tables?
2015-01-13 16:46 <skay> table amnesty day is when we don't pick on Carl for a day
2015-01-13 16:46 <skay> because tables are useful
2015-01-13 16:46 <DoormanDave> That sounds pretty difficult
2015-01-13 16:46 <DoormanDave> he's in summer right now, I just want to pick on him so bad.
2015-01-13 16:46 <skay> it could also mean that we table amnesty, which doesn't sound very nice
2015-01-13 16:47 <skay> unless your local is set to en_GB
2015-01-13 16:47 <DoormanDave> no way speak en_US.UTF8 or die.

2015-01-13 16:48 <NegativeK> Man, fuck.
2015-01-13 16:48 <Toba> i set my locale to en_gb to test something once
2015-01-13 16:48 <Toba> and then left it that way
2015-01-13 16:48 <Toba> and found so many weird localization bugs in webapps
2015-01-13 16:48 <Toba> by accident
2015-01-13 16:48 <Toba> for instance
2015-01-13 16:48 <NegativeK> Machine Shop Leprechaun has a height gage for scale that does 0.00001".
2015-01-13 16:48 <Toba> the illinois tollway will tell you all the money is pounds
2015-01-13 16:48 <Toba> without doing an exchange rate conversion
2015-01-13 16:48 <Toba> if your locale is en_gb
2015-01-13 16:49 <NegativeK> Hah!
2015-01-13 16:49 <skay> maybe it was a 1 that day
2015-01-13 16:49 <Toba> haha
2015-01-13 16:49 <Toba> no, i checked ;p
2015-01-13 16:49 <agocs> Set your locale to yen, and pay fines in yen

2015-01-13 16:54 <DoormanDave> So I made PAM and SSH work with Two Factor Auth via a yubikey last night
2015-01-13 16:54 <DoormanDave> it's pretty cool
2015-01-13 16:54 <skay> neat
2015-01-13 16:55 <skay> I got a yubikey with NFC but I haven't used that part yet
2015-01-13 16:55 <DoormanDave> might set it up on more VPSs

2015-01-13 17:45 <KyleB> Oh, I understand. I literally mean that I don't have the information to form an opinion on what the right price level is.
2015-01-13 17:45 <hef> The last time I did one, we wanted equipment to be voted on regardless of cost
2015-01-13 17:45 <hef> we were pressed for a hard dollar amount, so we came up with $500
2015-01-13 17:45 <loans> KyleB: it's a balancing act - how much autonomy do we want to grant area hosts?
2015-01-13 17:46 <hef> so people end up buying "pieces" of equipment for under $500 and putting them together
2015-01-13 17:46 <loans> i tend towards less autonomy, because i really believe the membership needs to be involved in decision making
2015-01-13 17:46 <bry> my opinion is on the mailing list
2015-01-13 17:46 <bry> so yeah
2015-01-13 17:47 <bry> I'm very much with derek
2015-01-13 17:47 <bry> I'm also worried about a line in the background
2015-01-13 17:47 <KyleB> Yup, I understand the tension. I am inclined to favor some autonomy, but is $500 or $750 the right autonomy? I have no idea. Plus, I don't have a vote.
2015-01-13 17:48 <bry> "	â€¢	Provide area hosts with more spending power to provide better service to the membership without the hassle of passing a vote"
2015-01-13 17:48 <bry> I am of the firm belief that if you are going to spend significant amounts of space money
2015-01-13 17:48 <bry> that you have to talk to the space
2015-01-13 17:48 <bry> that's the deal
2015-01-13 17:49 <bry> and it needs to be in detail, this one line item with $1k attached to it is not okay
2015-01-13 17:49 <KyleB> Speaking of not having a vote, how do I upgrade my membership and spend my reward points? Is there an interface, or is it just an email to "info@"?

2015-01-13 17:50 <hef> KyleB: If I ever get paypal integration working, I can make claiming member points automatic

2015-01-13 17:53 <loans> KyleB: also, if you want to see what happens when you mail info@, log into https://rt.pumpingstationone.org
2015-01-13 17:53 <sylphiae> yeah, as soon as i saw that you emailed us at 1 am, with very valid concerns, i thought we would probably have to postpone 
2015-01-13 17:53 <sylphiae> i know justin did a lot of work last night on trying to address the issues raised so far
2015-01-13 17:53 <bry> I meant to get that in earlier
2015-01-13 17:53 <bry> sorry!
2015-01-13 17:53 <loans> sylphiae: 1 week is often not enough time for discussion to get rolling
2015-01-13 17:53 <sylphiae> and i helped with some minor edits 
2015-01-13 17:53 <sylphiae> np np
2015-01-13 17:53 <loans> it's kind of a pattern
2015-01-13 17:53 <loans> it seems like shit always flairs up around the tuesday
2015-01-13 17:53 <bry> It's very hard to motivate myself to work on anything financial right now
2015-01-13 17:54 <sylphiae> yeah, i had noticed that too:-/ 
2015-01-13 17:54 <sylphiae> bry: np at all, that's understandable completely
2015-01-13 17:54 <bry> thank you all 3 for working on it! `justin sylphiae t_j
2015-01-13 17:54 <sylphiae> anyways, i think we both noted that for the most part what we were correcting last night were relatively minor issues
2015-01-13 17:55 <sylphiae> also it is important to have enough time for the board hand off meeting o.O 
2015-01-13 17:55 <DoormanDave> sylphiae: yeah I dont think that would have passed without more time for discussion and corrections, thanks!
2015-01-13 17:55 <bry> I need more time so I can horrify you all
2015-01-13 17:55 <Toba> ha

2015-01-13 17:57 <bry> Toba: you should dm
2015-01-13 17:57 <hef> wow
2015-01-13 17:57 <hef> dpt was strangely appropriate
2015-01-13 17:57 <Toba> haha
2015-01-13 17:57 <Toba> courage is being scared to death but board'ing anyway; dark pink elections;
2015-01-13 17:57 <DoormanDave> waterboarding?
2015-01-13 17:57 <Toba> that's not the same thing
2015-01-13 17:58 <NegativeK> You sure?
2015-01-13 17:58 <Toba> no.
2015-01-13 17:58 <hef> I have ipn sending messages to zirc
2015-01-13 17:58 <Toba> yay
2015-01-13 17:58 <hef> except waiting for ipn to come through sucks
2015-01-13 17:58 <Toba> let's hope nobody put their social security number in their email address
2015-01-13 17:58 <hef> so I don't know if it's goign to work or not
2015-01-13 17:59 <Toba> ...actually, i bet at least one person has done that at one point
2015-01-13 17:59 <DoormanDave> I knew a former USMC psychological interrogator dude who allegedly waterboarded people in Bosnia.
2015-01-13 17:59 <Toba> you know some weird people
2015-01-13 17:59 <NegativeK> ^
2015-01-13 17:59 <Toba> usmc interrogators, water administrators
2015-01-13 17:59 <NegativeK> Wait, allegedly?
2015-01-13 17:59 <hef> Toba: I'm not sending email's to zirc
2015-01-13 17:59 <DoormanDave> He would waterboard you if you were curious.
2015-01-13 17:59 <Toba> sausage photographers
2015-01-13 17:59 <NegativeK> Does that mean he didn't make the claim?
2015-01-13 17:59 <Toba> haha
2015-01-13 17:59 <NegativeK> Wait, I retract my statements and promise I'm not curious.
2015-01-13 17:59 <hef> first name/last name/membership level
2015-01-13 17:59 <NegativeK> ACTION so doesn't want to be waterboarded.
2015-01-13 17:59 <DoormanDave> And wore a teeshirt that said "I'd rather be waterboarding"
2015-01-13 17:59 <Toba> haha wow
2015-01-13 18:00 <NegativeK> =|
2015-01-13 18:00 <Toba> the worst.
2015-01-13 18:00 <NegativeK> ^
2015-01-13 18:01 <NegativeK> That's fucking weird.
2015-01-13 18:01 <loans> hef: the reason the beaglebone crashed the first time you pushed the button was i accidentally hooked it to the reset pin
2015-01-13 18:01 <loans> so uh
2015-01-13 18:01 <hef> hah
2015-01-13 18:01 <loans> works as intended
2015-01-13 18:02 <hef> the internet button
2015-01-13 18:02 <hef> ooh, it still sends messages to irc, right?
2015-01-13 18:03 <loans> should
2015-01-13 18:03 <loans> someone go ring the doorbell
2015-01-13 18:03 <loans> i left the python thing running in a tmux session
2015-01-13 18:03 <loans> i'll probably roll it into the doormon service
2015-01-13 18:03 <loans> until i refactor doormon into something saner than bash and awk
2015-01-13 18:03 <NegativeK> Bullshit.
2015-01-13 18:03 <loans> haha
2015-01-13 18:03 <NegativeK> Don't you dare.
2015-01-13 18:04 <loans> fair
2015-01-13 18:04 <hef> yeah, we are going to need to figure out how to organize or code
2015-01-13 18:04 <DoormanDave> there is nothing more sane than bash and awk
2015-01-13 18:04 <hef> I have 2 neurons running that I don't have in git
2015-01-13 18:04 <hef> they started out as demos aor test scripts
2015-01-13 18:04 <hef> or
2015-01-13 18:04 <hef> and now they do cool shit
2015-01-13 18:05 <DoormanDave> should we set up gitlab or something internally?
2015-01-13 18:05 <loans> that might actuallly make some sense
2015-01-13 18:05 <DoormanDave> rather than dealing with github and pr's
2015-01-13 18:05 <loans> for all the tiny shit that's happening
2015-01-13 18:05 <DoormanDave> actually just merge branches into a main master that is shared?
2015-01-13 18:05 <hef> hmm, If we stick with github, we might stand a chance at getting another hackerspace involved at some point
2015-01-13 18:05 <loans> true
2015-01-13 18:05 <NegativeK> Weird.
2015-01-13 18:05 <DoormanDave> yeah, you could still push master there whenever you merge in personal branches with smaller fixes
2015-01-13 18:05 <NegativeK> http://i.imgur.com/GpnNEK4.png
2015-01-13 18:06 <Toba> man
2015-01-13 18:06 <hef> I'd rather PR into master
2015-01-13 18:06 <Toba> what's with this trend of distros to be super tied to one window manager
2015-01-13 18:06 <hef> so that we can do code reviews
2015-01-13 18:06 <NegativeK> Each distinct slope is a batch of 500 messages.
2015-01-13 18:06 <Toba> and to switch, the normal way is to switch distros
2015-01-13 18:06 <Toba> this is bullshit.
2015-01-13 18:06 <hef> Toba: window managers are a lot of maitinance on the distro
2015-01-13 18:06 <Toba> that's just another app, why the fuck are there 'flavored' ubuntus for it?
2015-01-13 18:06 <NegativeK> The slope resets when I wait a few and start the message batch of 500 again.
2015-01-13 18:06 <Toba> I guess so... ugh
2015-01-13 18:06 <NegativeK> Maybe not 500.  Whatever.
2015-01-13 18:06 <Toba> it didn't use to be this way
2015-01-13 18:07 <loans> Toba: install arch
2015-01-13 18:07 <hef> and ubuntu said it well: they want users to have the same experience unless they are exports on why it's not the same
2015-01-13 18:07 <hef> experts
2015-01-13 18:07 <loans> Toba: the various ubuntu flavors are also targeted differently, i think
2015-01-13 18:07 <NegativeK> Uh.
2015-01-13 18:07 <NegativeK> I ran XMonad and E17 on Ubuntu without trouble.
2015-01-13 18:07 <Toba> got my qemu shit working more last night.
2015-01-13 18:07 <NegativeK> It might've left packages everywhere, but it worked.
2015-01-13 18:07 <Toba> I should learn xmonad, I haven't tried it for like 4 years
2015-01-13 18:07 <Toba> I was too impatient last time
2015-01-13 18:07 <NegativeK> Easy peasy, especially if you like the defaults.
2015-01-13 18:08 <DoormanDave> my issue with GH is it becomes more about publishing code and good VC practices fall to the back burner sometimes
2015-01-13 18:08 <Toba> spending the time to learn its tricks, is worth it, I gather.
2015-01-13 18:08 <loans> xmonad's defaults are super usable
2015-01-13 18:08 <Toba> :)
2015-01-13 18:08 <NegativeK> DoormanDave: VC?
2015-01-13 18:08 <Toba> unity's aren't
2015-01-13 18:08 <Toba> ha
2015-01-13 18:08 <loans> except that awful red border
2015-01-13 18:08 <Toba> white borders for me!
2015-01-13 18:08 <NegativeK> ^ Also easy.
2015-01-13 18:08 <loans> better learn haskell
2015-01-13 18:08 <DoormanDave> so I prefer just having a personal bare repo somewhere to push to most of the time
2015-01-13 18:08 <loans> 'easy'
2015-01-13 18:08 <Toba> haha
2015-01-13 18:08 <Toba> i already know haskell, loans
2015-01-13 18:08 <Toba> well
2015-01-13 18:08 <Toba> 'know'
2015-01-13 18:08 <DoormanDave> then a GH branch to push to to "publish"
2015-01-13 18:08 <NegativeK> Oh, version control.
2015-01-13 18:08 <Toba> I wrote a bunch of shit in haskell in 2009
2015-01-13 18:08 <DoormanDave> NegativeK: yeh
2015-01-13 18:08 <Toba> it was not a good idea
2015-01-13 18:08 <hef> DoormanDave: why not use git flow?
2015-01-13 18:08 <Toba> but I vaguely know haskell
2015-01-13 18:09 <hef> I use develop like you use a 2nd repo
2015-01-13 18:09 <NegativeK> Git flow + GitHub == simple.
2015-01-13 18:09 <Toba> ^
2015-01-13 18:09 <Toba> true fact
2015-01-13 18:09 <hef> ^^
2015-01-13 18:09 <NegativeK> !exec | > 
2015-01-13 18:09 <DoormanDave> not familiar with git flow
2015-01-13 18:10 <hef> there is a program for it, but think of it as a set if conventions
2015-01-13 18:10 <NegativeK> There are really simple commands to let you do http://nvie.com/img/git-model@2x.png
2015-01-13 18:10 <hef> master becomes your publish branch
2015-01-13 18:10 <hef> develop is your development branch
2015-01-13 18:10 <NegativeK> (I advocate not showing people that diagram at the start, but you're an adult.)
2015-01-13 18:10 <hef> there are feature brancehs in features/*
2015-01-13 18:10 <zirc> Door Unlocked
2015-01-13 18:10 <NegativeK> !open
2015-01-13 18:10 <loans> i think what i'm hearing is that we should probably have a 'code in the space' meeting/chat/hangout/whatevs
2015-01-13 18:10 <hef> NegativeK: yeah, that diagram was show to me, I did not understand it
2015-01-13 18:11 <NegativeK> hef: When I pitched/taught flow here, I hid it until the end.
2015-01-13 18:11 <hef> *the first time that diagram...
2015-01-13 18:11 <hef> sounds like a good plan
2015-01-13 18:11 <NegativeK> The blog post has smaller chunks that build up to that.
2015-01-13 18:12 <hef> DoormanDave: you end up running commands like "git flow feature start new_thing"
2015-01-13 18:12 <hef> and "git flow release start 1.2.12"
2015-01-13 18:12 <DoormanDave> I see
2015-01-13 18:12 <NegativeK> `git flow release finish <release number>` merges the release into master and develop and tags it.
2015-01-13 18:12 <hef> ^
2015-01-13 18:13 <DoormanDave> eh, but I learned all that stuff the hard way =P
2015-01-13 18:13 <NegativeK> But with git flow you can git other people on board more easily.
2015-01-13 18:13 <loans> also someone should talk about git flow
2015-01-13 18:13 <NegativeK> loans: That kind of thing could happen on Sensor Saturdays.
2015-01-13 18:13 <DoormanDave> it does look nice
2015-01-13 18:13 <hef> It's easier to sell people on git flow when they have experienced a lack of convention in git branching
2015-01-13 18:13 <loans> is sensor saturdays a thing
2015-01-13 18:13 <NegativeK> Only once it starts happening again.
2015-01-13 18:14 <NegativeK> Sensible Saturdays.
2015-01-13 18:14 <NegativeK> Toba: Put ^ on the calendar.
2015-01-13 18:14 <DoormanDave> but doesn't really appeal to me because it's just relearning a syntax for something I already have more control over.
2015-01-13 18:14 <hef> loans: I figured we were just keep going to do your Let meet on a saturday and talk about some tech thing
2015-01-13 18:14 <DoormanDave> but I see the merit in learning it
2015-01-13 18:14 <DoormanDave> for collaboration's sake
2015-01-13 18:14 <loans> oh, right, i did that
2015-01-13 18:14 <NegativeK> Higher up here doesn't know what git merge does, so having git flow helps.
2015-01-13 18:14 <loans> fair
2015-01-13 18:14 <DoormanDave> I can see that
2015-01-13 18:14 <hef> DoormanDave: git flow can be practiced without the program
2015-01-13 18:15 <Bioguy> wow, very cool.  Our japanese corporate group is incorporating "Year of the Sheep" into their 2015 business model, as it will be auspicious.
2015-01-13 18:15 <NegativeK> Actually, the blog that image came from listed the commands out, because the git addon didn't exist.
2015-01-13 18:15 <loans> Bioguy: wool for all?
2015-01-13 18:15 <Bioguy> loans: warmth and security whilst leaping into the future or something.
2015-01-13 18:16 <Bioguy> loans: This will be one of my questions of the potential new board: how will you incoporate the Year of The Sheep into 2015 goalsetting, in an auspicious manner
2015-01-13 18:16 <DoormanDave> wait hold on back up
2015-01-13 18:17 <DoormanDave> what does your higher up do that he a: uses git and b: doesn't know what merge does?
2015-01-13 18:17 <NegativeK> Cowboy Coder.
2015-01-13 18:17 <DoormanDave> does he know what branch or checkout do?
2015-01-13 18:17 <NegativeK> Maybe.

2015-01-13 18:18 <DoormanDave> does he think there is just a million divergant code forks that never come back together?
2015-01-13 18:18 <hef> I have trouble explaining git branches to devs sometimes
2015-01-13 18:18 <hef> DoormanDave: usually they don't imagine divergant forks
2015-01-13 18:18 <hef> or they thing branches are like copies
2015-01-13 18:18 <hef> ala svn era branches
2015-01-13 18:18 <NegativeK> I don't think his usual M.O. is to fork ever.
2015-01-13 18:18 <NegativeK> Develop on master, et cetera.
2015-01-13 18:19 <DoormanDave> Ah
2015-01-13 18:19 <DoormanDave> Likes to fly by the seat of his pant(y)s?
2015-01-13 18:20 <NegativeK> He made a sweeping architecture decision after about an hour of Googling and haranguing the devs.
2015-01-13 18:20 <NegativeK> Soooooo yup. >.>
2015-01-13 18:20 <DoormanDave> at least no more time was spent haranguing
2015-01-13 18:20 <NegativeK> Hahahahaha.
2015-01-13 18:20 <DoormanDave> oh snap
2015-01-13 18:20 <DoormanDave> I need to email loans a thing
2015-01-13 18:21 <DoormanDave> "You should vote for me because I'm your only option, really."
2015-01-13 18:21 <DoormanDave> "Or run for CTO if you want, I don't care."
2015-01-13 18:21 <hef> I like the one you sent to the list
2015-01-13 18:21 <NegativeK> ^
2015-01-13 18:21 <DoormanDave> yeah
2015-01-13 18:22 <DoormanDave> I did send one to the list 
2015-01-13 18:22 <DoormanDave> but I was going to synopsize it and email it to loans to include with the rest
2015-01-13 18:24 <sylphiae> yeah, that was good
2015-01-13 18:24 <DoormanDave> I can words.
2015-01-13 18:24 <NegativeK> One words, please.

2015-01-13 20:49 <Toba> haha
2015-01-13 20:49 <Toba> I was just trying to lower the quality of the discourse
2015-01-13 20:49 <DoormanDave> my dentist is a personal friend
2015-01-13 20:49 <NegativeK> Wake up and the dentist is elbow deep..
2015-01-13 20:49 <Toba> oh
2015-01-13 20:49 <Toba> what kind of friend are we talking
2015-01-13 20:49 <Toba> does this friend have dental benefits
2015-01-13 20:49 <Toba> if you know what i mean
2015-01-13 20:49 <NegativeK> I don't.
2015-01-13 20:49 <NegativeK> Elaborate.
2015-01-13 20:49 <Toba> me either.
2015-01-13 20:50 <Toba> it's unfortunate not having dental insurance
2015-01-13 20:50 <Toba> I need some fillings done, and it's gonna cost me.
2015-01-13 20:50 <NegativeK> "If you know what I mean.. Please tell me."
2015-01-13 20:50 <Toba> haha.
2015-01-13 20:50 <Toba> please, go on.
2015-01-13 20:50 <DoormanDave> yeah, one time she exchanged a sonic cleaning for me stripper her radiators
2015-01-13 20:50 <NegativeK> Natch.

2015-01-13 20:50 <DoormanDave> freudian slip
2015-01-13 20:50 <Toba> ha
2015-01-13 20:50 <NegativeK> Freudian dentist.
2015-01-13 20:50 <Toba> i think 'chained to a radiator' is definitely a very dark take on a stripper pole
2015-01-13 20:51 <Toba> you're onto something though, dave
2015-01-13 20:51 <Toba> you're a stripping innovator
2015-01-13 20:51 <NegativeK> He's on a radiator.
2015-01-13 20:51 <Toba> this got weird.
2015-01-13 20:51 <Toba> actually, this started weird.
2015-01-13 20:51 <loans> DoormanDave: i would not attend a dentist who was also a friend of yours. no offense, but your friends are generally a bunch of folks i probably wouldn't seek medical care from
2015-01-13 20:51 <NegativeK> Stayed weird.
2015-01-13 20:51 <DoormanDave> loans: fair enough
2015-01-13 20:51 <NegativeK> Hahaha, right with loans.
2015-01-13 20:52 <Toba> i would let his water dept guy do my teeth
2015-01-13 20:52 <Toba> he seems legit
2015-01-13 20:52 <asl2> I have heard that UIC dental school provides cheap work, but it takes longer
2015-01-13 20:52 <Toba> maybe the water boarding guy
2015-01-13 20:52 <DoormanDave> haha
2015-01-13 20:52 <NegativeK> Toba: Phrasing.
2015-01-13 20:52 <Toba> what?
2015-01-13 20:52 <asl2> since you have a professor supervising the students
2015-01-13 20:52 <NegativeK> Fuck if I know.
2015-01-13 20:52 <DoormanDave> my pedicab friends have a bad habit of stitching eachother up instead of taking eachother to the hospital
2015-01-13 20:53 <NegativeK> Those people have each other in stitches.
2015-01-13 20:53 <DoormanDave> the scary part is that their actually good at it and no one has gotten infections.
2015-01-13 20:53 <Toba> nice
2015-01-13 20:53 <DoormanDave> I still urge them to stop stitching eachother up.
2015-01-13 20:53 <DoormanDave> cause nasty.
2015-01-13 20:54 <DoormanDave> if it can't be super glued, take them to the ER
2015-01-13 20:54 <DoormanDave> dental floss is not for stitches.
2015-01-13 20:54 <NegativeK> lol
2015-01-13 20:55 <Toba> uh
2015-01-13 20:55 <Toba> dental floss eh
2015-01-13 20:55 <Toba> that's a bit far
2015-01-13 20:55 <NegativeK> Versus what?

2015-01-13 20:55 <agocs> bailing twine

2015-01-14 17:01 <Toba> yeah, screw prootbufs
2015-01-14 17:01 <Toba> for that
2015-01-14 17:01 <Toba> you have a solid point hef
2015-01-14 17:02 <Toba> pull req please, I dig this idea
2015-01-14 17:02 <Toba> lets try it out
2015-01-14 17:02 <hef> yay
2015-01-14 17:02 <hef> I was converting our samples that use raw strings at the moment
2015-01-14 17:02 <hef> and was switching them to use json messages
2015-01-14 17:02 <hef> and that's what led me to this line of thinking
2015-01-14 17:02 <Toba> yeah
2015-01-14 17:02 <Toba> not a bad one
2015-01-14 17:03 <Toba> it supports everything json does right?
2015-01-14 17:03 <Toba> types, i mean
2015-01-14 17:03 <hef> yeah
2015-01-14 17:03 <hef> and then some

2015-01-14 17:12 <hef> There are a few places in England where private security looks just like the police force, minus badges

2015-01-14 17:12 <hef> Toba: FTFA the security force works with the local police
2015-01-14 17:13 <asl2> for a while we had a volunteer anti-gaybashing organization like that - http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/07/us/pink-angels-battle-anti-gay-crime.html
2015-01-14 17:13 <hef> and from the wikipedia article, fake uniform/fake vehicle would be a problem here
2015-01-14 17:13 <asl2> I dunno if they still exist
2015-01-14 17:16 <hef> The Guardian Angels still exist in chucago.
2015-01-14 17:16 <asl2> as long as they have a distinctive uniform, mostly patrol areas heavily populated by members of the targeted group, are unarmed, and don't have actual police powers (like making arrests), I don't see the problem
2015-01-14 17:16 <Toba> I knew a guy who was involved with the guardian angels
2015-01-14 17:16 <Toba> or really loved them
2015-01-14 17:16 <Toba> I can't tell whether the guardian angels are a good thing or not
2015-01-14 17:16 <Toba> it seems sorta worrying.
2015-01-14 17:16 <Toba> in some ways
2015-01-14 17:16 <Toba> it seems like a gang dressed up pretty
2015-01-14 17:17 <Toba> they exercise a lot of control over their members or something...
2015-01-14 17:18 <asl2> if gang members were unarmed and didn't engage in illegal activities, I'm not sure what I'd find objectionable about them
2015-01-14 17:18 <Toba> fair enough :)
2015-01-14 17:24 <hef> asl2: citizen arrest is a thing
2015-01-14 17:24 <hef> it's difficult to do correctly
2015-01-14 17:25 <Toba> it is
2015-01-14 17:25 <asl2> that's fair, and I could be persuaded that an organized unarmed group could be trained in its use
2015-01-14 17:28 <bjonnh> asl2: you mean if gangs were not gangs?
2015-01-14 17:29 <asl2> bjonnh: they could still be organizations providing a sense of community

2015-01-14 17:31 <asl2> see http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1969/05/chicagos-blackstone-rangers-i/305741/ for a bit of history on one chicago gang - I don't know how the analysis has held up over the years
2015-01-14 17:31 <bjonnh> asl2: which are not gangs ;)
2015-01-14 17:32 <bjonnh> asl2: like local church
2015-01-14 17:32 <bjonnh> asl2: or veteran association
2015-01-14 17:32 <bjonnh> asl2: or neighbors associations
2015-01-14 17:32 <bjonnh> asl2: or stray cats groups
2015-01-14 17:34 <hef1> I think citizin's arrest applies when a burglar gets locked in to a place
2015-01-14 17:34 <hef1> like when they lock the security doors in a convenience store/gas station
2015-01-14 17:36 <kuroishi> some landlord locked their tennants in their house once and a TOOOL member responded to the 911 call
2015-01-14 17:38 <bjonnh> seriously?

2015-01-14 17:38 <Toba> that's hilarious
2015-01-14 17:38 <Toba> was the TOOOL member a cop?
2015-01-14 17:38 <Toba> or did someone just listen to the scanner
2015-01-14 17:38 <bjonnh> that's what I was going to ask
2015-01-14 17:38 <Toba> because if the latter

2015-01-14 17:39 <Toba> hm, how would a cop determine if someone has a valid lease without entering the house
2015-01-14 17:39 <Toba> if their only copy is in the house
2015-01-14 17:39 <hef1> Toba: read that again

2015-01-14 17:40 <Toba> yeah, I misread that
2015-01-14 17:40 <kuroishi> no more like "That's unlawful restraint" 
2015-01-14 17:40 <asl2> I once asked a friend to help me get into my apartment, because the keys the landlord issued didn't work - we had a copy of the lease with us

2015-01-14 18:27 <kuroishi> well, I reached out to them to see if they offer any sort of reduced/complementary licensing and it seems prohibitively expensive to use for more than a handful of "Active users" per month, active is defined as having logged in within 30 days
2015-01-14 18:28 <kuroishi> but I was hoping they'd give it to us for free and it would work and be easier than dealing with maven overlays whenever the SSO backend requires maintenance

2015-01-14 18:45 <asl2> then I stopped coming in
2015-01-14 18:46 <`justin> and i was like "ummm maybe if you became a totally different company with totally different people running it."
2015-01-14 18:46 <asl2> sometime later they stopped paying me
2015-01-14 18:46 <`justin> to their credit though
2015-01-14 18:46 <`justin> they did not try to counteroffer
2015-01-14 18:46 <NegativeK> asl2: That sounds like some weird breakup.
2015-01-14 18:46 <asl2> I still get xmas cards from the boss
2015-01-14 18:46 <kuroishi> yeah if my old boss wants to step down and let me run the support team from home for more money is the only way I'm going back to lispland
2015-01-14 18:46 <asl2> it was an unpleasantly codependent relationship
2015-01-14 18:46 <NegativeK> asl2: That sounds like employment in general.
2015-01-14 18:47 <`justin> NegativeK: only programming jobs
2015-01-14 18:47 <NegativeK> This fucking auction right here. Jesus fuck. http://www.bidspotter.com/en-us/auction-catalogues/timed/heath-industrial/catalogue-id-bsche10136

2015-01-14 18:54 <sylphiae> kuroishi: emailed you
2015-01-14 18:57 <kuroishi> cool
2015-01-14 18:58 <sylphiae> hmm, GoT soundtrack on rdio now
2015-01-14 19:07 <`justin> "The Company reserves the right to take necessary action to maintain a safe work
2015-01-14 19:07 <`justin> environment free from drugs and alcohol."
2015-01-14 19:07 <`justin> well then, they better tell the marketing dept to stop coming around with the beer cart
2015-01-14 19:07 <Toba> haha!
2015-01-14 19:09 <`justin> oh damn
2015-01-14 19:09 <`justin> they actually didn't contradict themselves
2015-01-14 19:09 <`justin> "When authorized by the Company, alcoholic beverages may be served on Company premises
2015-01-14 19:09 <`justin> and/or at Company-sponsored social events. "
2015-01-14 19:09 <`justin> those crafty HR people! :-)
2015-01-14 19:09 <loans> i mean
2015-01-14 19:09 <loans> that's kind of a contradiction
2015-01-14 19:09 <asl2> what about caffeine?
2015-01-14 19:09 <loans> "There's no alcohol except when we say so"
2015-01-14 19:10 <kuroishi> so many people with strong feelings against the budget seem to be operating on the assumption that line items are also authorizations for the area hosts to purchase said items, This is not true, correct?

2015-01-14 19:37 <agocs> Hey loans, did you ever join the gopher gala slack instance?
2015-01-14 19:37 <loans> i have not
2015-01-14 19:39 <agocs> Okeedoke. I went ahead and started a Chicago channel in that. I'll monitor it to see if anyone says anything
2015-01-14 19:40 <bjonnh> damn this license server is generating wrong host id when started as a serviceâ€¦
2015-01-14 19:40 <bjonnh> I have to restart it and then the host id is good
2015-01-14 19:40 <kuroishi> Quick poll: How do the active participants of this channel feel about me hosting a bike club event at the space that is a party and not necessarily geared towards making anything?
2015-01-14 19:41 <loans> if it's frequent and disruptive to normal operations, i'd be annoyed
2015-01-14 19:41 <loans> if not frequent, then i wouldn't care much either way
2015-01-14 19:41 <kuroishi> it's a biannual event
2015-01-14 19:41 <agocs> Would it be disruptive?
2015-01-14 19:42 <kuroishi> involving shitbags in formalweard
2015-01-14 19:42 <kuroishi> it's Rat Patrol Prom
2015-01-14 19:42 <agocs> So, yes
2015-01-14 19:42 <kuroishi> yes
2015-01-14 19:42 <kuroishi> likely disruptive
2015-01-14 19:42 <kuroishi> but a one time thing with lots of notice
2015-01-14 19:42 <loans> infrequent disruptive events don't bother me
2015-01-14 19:43 <agocs> I probably wouldn't actively try to stop you
2015-01-14 19:43 <kuroishi> I'd be suprised if it didn't yeild a handful of new members as wee
2015-01-14 19:43 <kuroishi> well*
2015-01-14 19:43 <kuroishi> we're short on good welding space these days
2015-01-14 19:43 <sylphiae> well, you know everyone in the bike club, right? 
2015-01-14 19:44 <kuroishi> yes and no

2015-01-14 19:44 <kuroishi> we would likely be inviting out of town clubs/chapters to attend.
2015-01-14 19:44 <agocs> You'd take responsibility for all of their actions, right?
2015-01-14 19:44 <kuroishi> I would.
2015-01-14 19:44 <agocs> I will continue to not get in your way, in that case.
2015-01-14 19:45 <agocs> Might be worth researching maximum occupancy numbers, though
2015-01-14 19:45 <loans> that's something you gotta like
2015-01-14 19:45 <loans> get rated for
2015-01-14 19:45 <loans> we do need that
2015-01-14 19:45 <agocs> maximum occupancy guestimate
2015-01-14 19:46 <loans> that's less helpful
2015-01-14 19:46 <agocs> with a safety factor
2015-01-14 19:46 <agocs> Basically, so long as no fire marshal decides "huh, I should really see if what they're doing is safe"
2015-01-14 19:46 <bjonnh> kuroishi: will there be beer?
2015-01-14 19:47 <Toba> did someone say beer

2015-01-14 19:47 <agocs> < bjonnh > kuroishi: Will there be beer?
2015-01-14 19:47 <Toba> no.

2015-01-14 19:47 <sylphiae> we've only had issues with the occupy parties
2015-01-14 19:48 <Toba> tac get with it!

2015-01-14 19:48 <Toba> lol!
2015-01-14 19:48 <Toba> and one of our halloween parties that turned into an occupy party.
2015-01-14 19:48 <Toba> that was fun, but man what a mess.
2015-01-14 19:48 <agocs> The problem with occupy parties is that guests don't know when to leave
2015-01-14 19:48 <Toba> ^
2015-01-14 19:49 <sylphiae> heh
2015-01-14 19:49 <sylphiae> well, they also had some creepy hangerons

2015-01-14 19:49 <Toba> when he decided it was over
2015-01-14 19:49 <Toba> he put on his pajamas
2015-01-14 19:49 <Toba> and came out of his bedroom
2015-01-14 19:49 <Toba> and just yelled
2015-01-14 19:49 <Toba> HEY THANKS FOR COMING
2015-01-14 19:49 <Toba> which meant
2015-01-14 19:49 <Toba> 'glad to have you but now you have to leave'
2015-01-14 19:50 <Toba> we should try that at our next ps1 party

2015-01-14 19:51 <sylphiae> it works better with pajamas
2015-01-14 19:52 <agocs> That's what I sleep in, though
2015-01-14 19:52 <agocs> I don't see a reason to have a sleep uniform
2015-01-14 19:52 <agocs> like some kind of dream spaceship pilot
2015-01-14 19:53 <loans> hah
2015-01-14 19:54 <skay> sleep uniforms sound great
2015-01-14 19:54 <skay> my first year in college I signed up for 8am classes m-f because I got up that early fir high school so what could go wrong?
2015-01-14 19:55 <skay> I ended up going to class a few times in pjs
2015-01-14 19:55 <bjonnh> ^?
2015-01-14 19:55 <agocs> How often did you skip class?
2015-01-14 19:55 <skay> I can't remember, it was a long time ago
2015-01-14 19:55 <skay> I quickly learned that 8 am classses are not for me
2015-01-14 19:55 <sylphiae> hmm, in high school i did early bird gym once
2015-01-14 19:55 <sylphiae> i think those started at 7:20
2015-01-14 19:55 <sylphiae> i made less than half of them
2015-01-14 19:56 <skay> bjonnh: ?
2015-01-14 19:56 <kuroishi> "I use i3 as a window manager"
2015-01-14 19:56 <kuroishi> sylphiae: *highfive*
2015-01-14 19:56 <skay> I like i3, but I haven't switched because I can't remember how to set the network stuff via cli
2015-01-14 19:56 <sylphiae> oh? 
2015-01-14 19:56 <kuroishi> window manager of kings
2015-01-14 19:56 <skay> or how to mount my phone
2015-01-14 19:56 <sylphiae> i can barely use it though
2015-01-14 19:56 <kuroishi> skay: what network manager?
2015-01-14 19:56 <skay> I really like it. it reminds me of wmii but is easier to use
2015-01-14 19:57 <kuroishi> nmcli will let you configure NetworkManager from the cli, but you can also run tray apps like nm-applet from i3.
2015-01-14 19:57 <skay> kuroishi: I don't know. I am really really ignorant about that. I know that in the default ubuntu window manager, there is an icon thingee and I can fiddle around with it to get it to connect to something
2015-01-14 19:57 <kuroishi> yeah
2015-01-14 19:57 <skay> and then it "remembers" magically and will connect again later
2015-01-14 19:57 <kuroishi> start i3
2015-01-14 19:57 <kuroishi> meta-d
2015-01-14 19:57 <bjonnh> kuroishi: i3 too :p
2015-01-14 19:57 <skay> and then sometimes I want to vpn
2015-01-14 19:57 <kuroishi> nm-applet
2015-01-14 19:57 <kuroishi> check it out =P
2015-01-14 19:57 <bjonnh> kuroishi: actually I made a dmenu script for my network
2015-01-14 19:58 <kuroishi> nice
2015-01-14 19:58 <bjonnh> kuroishi: for wifi I just run wifi-menu (netctl)
2015-01-14 19:58 <skay> sylphiae: what kinds of things do you find easy to do in windows that you would like to be able to do in linux? we could organize a class
2015-01-14 19:58 <skay> I asked in #chicagolug if people want to teach. where by people I mean misterbonnie and cmdrk so far
2015-01-14 19:58 <sylphiae> hmm
2015-01-14 19:58 <kuroishi> "Not understand how it works" is something I find easy in windows but difficult in linux =P
2015-01-14 19:59 <skay> kuroishi: I've kind of made due with enjoying tiles via spitting things in tmux
2015-01-14 19:59 <kuroishi> skay: I'm down to teach
2015-01-14 19:59 <skay> once I work out all teh things I want to do in i3 that I don't know how to do I would like to sswitch to it
2015-01-14 19:59 <sylphiae> i think i mentioned troubleshooting on list
2015-01-14 20:00 <sylphiae> i'd have to think about it more
2015-01-14 20:00 <greetermon> restart it and then the host id is good
2015-01-14 20:00 <kuroishi> i've been using it exclusively for ~2 years, lemme know if you have any i3 questions =D
2015-01-14 20:00 <kuroishi> ACTION <3s i3
2015-01-14 20:00 <sylphiae> i find installing more difficult in linux
2015-01-14 20:00 <sylphiae> mostly i want to learn how to use linux more efficiently
2015-01-14 20:00 <kuroishi> installing the OS or installing software?
2015-01-14 20:00 <skay> kuroishi: okay, I may bug you later. the network thing, the friendly automounting of my phone thing is another magic feature I get that I don't knwo how it works
2015-01-14 20:00 <greetermon> see a reason to have a notice on beer?
2015-01-14 20:00 <sylphiae> software, only because usually a ton of things are missing
2015-01-14 20:01 <skay> kuroishi: and souped up status bar thingee, but that sounds like learn some conky or something and do things that I leave as an exercise to myself later
2015-01-14 20:01 <kuroishi> skay: 
2015-01-14 20:01 <kuroishi> yeah
2015-01-14 20:02 <kuroishi> wat
2015-01-14 20:03 <loans> skay: network manager has a good cli interface
2015-01-14 20:03 <kuroishi> my conkyrc seems to have vanished

2015-01-14 20:03 <kuroishi> oh shit i'm not using that here that's right
2015-01-14 20:03 <kuroishi> damn

2015-01-14 20:09 <sylphiae> that might make more sense bjonnh
2015-01-14 20:10 <kuroishi> so our options for hosting this Rat Patrol event are currently: A church in Garfield Park

2015-01-14 20:19 <t_j> lp, premix, Ar/CO2
2015-01-14 20:20 <kuroishi> ar/c02 isn't explosive is it?
2015-01-14 20:20 <kuroishi> CO2*
2015-01-14 20:20 <t_j> no, but the premix 
2015-01-14 20:20 <kuroishi> for sure
2015-01-14 20:20 <t_j> i guess it is, considering the tank is at over 4000psi
2015-01-14 20:21 <kuroishi> hah

2015-01-14 20:23 <t_j> skay: was that you jeep need the space on elston?
2015-01-14 20:23 <agocs> Someone booted your jeep, skay ?
2015-01-14 20:23 <NegativeK> =(
2015-01-14 20:23 <skay> agocs t_j my jeep is booted on rockwell
2015-01-14 20:24 <sylphiae> that sucks:( 
2015-01-14 20:24 <agocs> How many boots?
2015-01-14 20:24 <NegativeK> We have a plasma cutter.
2015-01-14 20:24 <agocs> I have one jeep-sized spare tire
2015-01-14 20:24 <skay> I drove it to be at beans because I wanted to drive to the space later
2015-01-14 20:24 <agocs> (I used to have a stack of jeep wheels with shitty mounted tires, but my wife "didn't want to live with a pile of tires")
2015-01-14 20:25 <loans> agocs: does a boot not defeat removal of  wheel
2015-01-14 20:25 <skay> I'm taking the bus now. Will have to handle this in person!?

2015-01-14 20:25 <kuroishi> skay: how small are your wheels and how big are your tires?
2015-01-14 20:25 <agocs> loans: Depending on the boot, it may
2015-01-14 20:25 <kuroishi> I've gotten a boot off by deflating the tire before.
2015-01-14 20:25 <loans> skay: i'ma recommend the legal recourse depending on the booting authority
2015-01-14 20:25 <agocs> Some boots don't cover the lugs
2015-01-14 20:25 <kuroishi> more accurately, I've gotten access to the lugs to remove the wheel/boot by deflating the tire.
2015-01-14 20:25 <skay> haha
2015-01-14 20:26 <loans> now, to let some guy do stuff to my tooth
2015-01-14 20:26 <skay> I'll go with legal method
2015-01-14 20:26 <agocs> gl hf loans
2015-01-14 20:26 <`justin> loans: we have a plasma cutter
2015-01-14 20:26 <sylphiae> nice kuro
2015-01-14 20:26 <kuroishi> that way is more expensive and less fun, skay.
2015-01-14 20:26 <NegativeK> Plasma cut those gums.
2015-01-14 20:26 <t_j> I have a genny and a angle grinder
2015-01-14 20:26 <sylphiae> is that a hard or soft g?

2015-01-14 20:28 <agocs> hacksaw and patience
2015-01-14 20:28 <agocs> in sub-freezing weather
2015-01-14 20:28 <agocs> recipe for success
2015-01-14 20:28 <NegativeK> Dan Locks cut a bike lock off with a battery powered Dremel.
2015-01-14 20:28 <NegativeK> Said it took 10 minutes and the battery seemed happy that the weather was cooling it off.
2015-01-14 20:28 <kuroishi> 3ft bolt cutters can get a ulock if you hit it at the bend and put some weight into it
2015-01-14 20:28 <`justin> you can rent those from home depot ;-)
2015-01-14 20:29 <agocs> you can rent a lot of stuff at home depot
2015-01-14 20:30 <NegativeK> Can't rent me love.
2015-01-14 20:30 <t_j> NegativeK: false
2015-01-14 20:30 <`justin> sure you can
2015-01-14 20:30 <agocs> oh everett, I don't need to rent your love
2015-01-14 20:30 <NegativeK> t_j: `justin: Your definitions of love don't match the Beatles'.
2015-01-14 20:30 <agocs> Notice how he did not refute me
2015-01-14 20:31 <NegativeK> agocs: I could never turn you down.
2015-01-14 20:31 <t_j> NegativeK: sounds like you need some hookers and blow
2015-01-14 20:31 <NegativeK> Man, I love me some hookers and blow.
2015-01-14 20:31 <agocs> I once rented a chainsaw at Home Depot, because a tree had fallen across my favorite illicit place to drive a jeep back in Atlanta
2015-01-14 20:31 <`justin> beatles said can't _buy_ me love
2015-01-14 20:31 <NegativeK> agocs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMUDVMiITOU
2015-01-14 20:31 <`justin> never said shit about rentals
2015-01-14 20:31 <agocs> I got some looks
2015-01-14 20:31 <NegativeK> I have modified history.
2015-01-14 20:31 <sylphiae>  I really hope you get this fast. I could not inform everyone about my trip to Portugal for a short vacation unfortunately we were mugged at the park of the hotel we stayed I was mugged at gun point and all my valuables were stolen (cash, credit cards and phone, where I went for sightseeing before leaving to the airport since my return flight is in few hours. Luckily I had my passport in my hotel room to get me home. Its was a terrible experi
2015-01-14 20:31 <sylphiae> eep, i should've pastebinned that
2015-01-14 20:31 <agocs> It's a scammmmmmm
2015-01-14 20:31 <sylphiae> but i just got this email 
2015-01-14 20:31 <agocs> scammmmmmmmmm
2015-01-14 20:31 <NegativeK> Scaaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmmmmm.
2015-01-14 20:32 <agocs> don't send money
2015-01-14 20:32 <kuroishi> bad ideas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8yOizZW1Fg
2015-01-14 20:32 <NegativeK> Send me money.
2015-01-14 20:32 <agocs> send me the money
2015-01-14 20:32 <sylphiae> does anyone actually fall for this stuff? 
2015-01-14 20:32 <NegativeK> What!
2015-01-14 20:32 <agocs> with the expectation that I will not send it to the person in portugal
2015-01-14 20:32 <NegativeK> What the fuck is inside bowling balls?
2015-01-14 20:32 <NegativeK> sylphiae: Yes.
2015-01-14 20:32 <kuroishi> I don't know, plasticy stuff that burns AMAZINGLY
2015-01-14 20:32 <`justin> sylphiae: yup
2015-01-14 20:32 <kuroishi> I've thrown bowling balls in bonfires before
2015-01-14 20:33 <kuroishi> to great effect
2015-01-14 20:33 <NegativeK> Half of the questions on /r/chicago can be solved with "Don't give money to people who are asking for it."
2015-01-14 20:33 <kuroishi> and great clouds of black smoke
2015-01-14 20:33 <`justin> my cousin's grandparents (through the parent that's not related to me) fell for the "I'm your grandson in mexican prison" scam
2015-01-14 20:33 <agocs> sylphiae: email scammers make scams easy to detect now, because the rare person that does not know about the scam can be scammed for a huge amount
2015-01-14 20:33 <NegativeK> "So, this person knocked on my door about my electric bill.." "Call your utility instead."
2015-01-14 20:33 <kuroishi> yeah those people drive me nuts
2015-01-14 20:33 <NegativeK> "This guy on the train was telling us about how he needs meds.." "Give money to a shelter."
2015-01-14 20:33 <agocs> `justin: I once actually knew a guy who accidentally wound up in mexican prison
2015-01-14 20:34 <sylphiae> smh
2015-01-14 20:34 <`justin> that one was actually over the phone
2015-01-14 20:34 <agocs> `justin: gave someone fifty bucks and my cell phone to try to get him out
2015-01-14 20:34 <`justin> agocs: i'm not sending him money
2015-01-14 20:34 <NegativeK> `justin: Wow.
2015-01-14 20:34 <kuroishi> I'm pretty sure their legit, but showing up and knocking on my door and asking to see my bill full of my personal information is not going to happen
2015-01-14 20:34 <agocs> `justin: I got my fifty bucks and phone back that night
2015-01-14 20:34 <sylphiae> agocs: good for you
2015-01-14 20:34 <`justin> funny thing was that the scammers claimed to be my cousin
2015-01-14 20:34 <`justin> who lives in paris
2015-01-14 20:34 <NegativeK> kuroishi: I think a lot of them are signing up people for a provider change without their permission.
2015-01-14 20:35 <kuroishi> so flaming bowling balls are pretty cool.
2015-01-14 20:36 <NegativeK> Goodness gracious.
2015-01-14 20:36 <kuroishi> I happen to know a good source of bowling balls
2015-01-14 20:36 <kuroishi> (The river behind diversey rock and bowl)
2015-01-14 20:36 <agocs> I happen to know a good sink for flaming bowling balls
2015-01-14 20:37 <agocs> (the river, potentially behind diversey rock and bowl)
2015-01-14 20:37 <`justin> anyways, my cousin's grandparents basically gave away their entire life savings to these scammers
2015-01-14 20:37 <agocs> )=
2015-01-14 20:37 <kuroishi> ouch
2015-01-14 20:37 <`justin> it was pretty shitty
2015-01-14 20:37 <`justin> not even all at once
2015-01-14 20:37 <`justin> like
2015-01-14 20:37 <NegativeK> =(
2015-01-14 20:37 <`justin> the scammers called back and asked for more money
2015-01-14 20:37 <`justin> and they gave it to them
2015-01-14 20:38 <kuroishi> yeah we had a customer at my old VPS hosting gig who would get extorted via DDoS 
2015-01-14 20:38 <kuroishi> "Pay us to stop"
2015-01-14 20:38 <kuroishi> and he would
2015-01-14 20:38 <kuroishi> then they would just start again and demand more money
2015-01-14 20:38 <sylphiae> o.O 
2015-01-14 20:38 <kuroishi> we finally went to kick him off our network
2015-01-14 20:38 <kuroishi> and he goes "No I promise they'll stop."
2015-01-14 20:38 <kuroishi> "Wat?  How do you know that?"
2015-01-14 20:38 <kuroishi> "I paid them to stop"
2015-01-14 20:39 <agocs> When I get old, I'll probably rig it so that any big wire transfers I make have to go through my kids first.
2015-01-14 20:39 <sylphiae> hah
2015-01-14 20:39 <Nerobro> "that's not how you get them to stop..."
2015-01-14 20:39 <kuroishi> that's how you make your webhosting company stop hosting you
2015-01-14 20:40 <`justin> agocs: that's not exactly foolproof
2015-01-14 20:40 <`justin> consider that the scammers new my cousins name when they were claiming to be him
2015-01-14 20:40 <kuroishi> if your kids are fools.
2015-01-14 20:40 <NegativeK> Fools, I tell you!
2015-01-14 20:40 <`justin> theirs a running theory by just about everyone ever that it was actually one of his scumbag uncles or cousins
2015-01-14 20:40 <Toba> http://penny-arcade.com/comic/2015/01/14
2015-01-14 20:40 <Toba> ^ minecraft
2015-01-14 20:40 <`justin> scamming their own parents/grandparents
2015-01-14 20:41 <agocs> `justin: true, but my kids are more likely to say "Dammit dad, the deposed Moon Prince does not exist; he certainly does not need 50,000 credits to transfer you his fast H3 reserves"
2015-01-14 20:41 <`justin> "I'll believe in the Moon Prince if I want to!"
2015-01-14 20:42 <NegativeK> You can't tell me who to moon after!
2015-01-14 20:42 <agocs> And plus, I'll probably die early of traumatic injuries rather than become old and senile
2015-01-14 20:42 <agocs> if I keep up my current lifestyle
2015-01-14 20:43 <agocs> w/r/t throwing myself at concrete walls
2015-01-14 20:43 <sylphiae> the better way to go
2015-01-14 20:43 <kuroishi> crashing motorcycles is not a lifestyle choice that is made lightly.
2015-01-14 20:43 <`justin> oh, i hear doctors are saying that's bad for you now
2015-01-14 20:43 <`justin> like
2015-01-14 20:43 <kuroishi> it takes dedication/.
2015-01-14 20:43 <`justin> it causes cancer or something
2015-01-14 20:43 <agocs> boneitis
2015-01-14 20:43 <Toba> well
2015-01-14 20:43 <Nerobro> kuroishi, say what?
2015-01-14 20:43 <Toba> you can end up with a white cross on the road dedicated to you
2015-01-14 20:43 <Toba> easily
2015-01-14 20:43 <Toba> so that's one kind of dedication.

2015-01-14 20:44 <`justin> i think they sell them at the dollar store
2015-01-14 20:44 <bry> My great uncle used to get my great grandma to give him drug money
2015-01-14 20:44 <`justin> that would be... his sister?
2015-01-14 20:44 <bry> I don't think so
2015-01-14 20:44 <kuroishi> mom
2015-01-14 20:44 <bry> My mom's uncle
2015-01-14 20:44 <`justin> oh right
2015-01-14 20:45 <`justin> great aunt/uncle comes in one level lower
2015-01-14 20:45 <agocs> "Hey ma, lemme get some drug money"
2015-01-14 20:45 <`justin> so his mother then?
2015-01-14 20:45 <agocs> "okay, here you go"
2015-01-14 20:45 <kuroishi> that's how my mom rolls.
2015-01-14 20:45 <bry> anywho, so my great grandma died and split her estate between my grandma and great uncle
2015-01-14 20:45 <`justin> or i guess he could be the nephew at that point
2015-01-14 20:46 <bry> and then shortly after, my great uncle dies
2015-01-14 20:46 <bry> ends up that he put in his will that all of my grandma's descendants were banned from his funeral
2015-01-14 20:46 <`justin> bry: drug overdose?
2015-01-14 20:46 <bry> and that he donated all of my great grandma's money
2015-01-14 20:46 <bry> to a trust
2015-01-14 20:46 <bry> for his cats
2015-01-14 20:46 <kuroishi> bry: was this just recently?
2015-01-14 20:47 <`justin> if someone bans me from their funeral, i don't think i would want to go anyways
2015-01-14 20:47 <agocs> kuroishi: "Hey Dave, you got twenty bucks? I'll split an eighth with you" "Sure thing, mom"
2015-01-14 20:47 <bry> fairly recently
2015-01-14 20:47 <kuroishi> agocs: that has happened.
2015-01-14 20:47 <kuroishi> but in greater quantities
2015-01-14 20:47 <bry> Yeah, I met and remember my great great grandmother
2015-01-14 20:47 <`justin> a trust for his cats
2015-01-14 20:47 <`justin> yeah
2015-01-14 20:47 <bry> great great grandma johnson
2015-01-14 20:47 <bry> she used to braid my hair
2015-01-14 20:47 <`justin> people shouldn't write their will when high on drugs
2015-01-14 20:47 <bry> before she got demensia
2015-01-14 20:48 <bry> He did it on purpose
2015-01-14 20:48 <bry> he was a complete ass
2015-01-14 20:48 <kuroishi> like, in 2014? a very similar story happened to my friend
2015-01-14 20:48 <NegativeK> I want to put Rick Roll or something in my will.
2015-01-14 20:48 <bry> so his life partner, frank
2015-01-14 20:48 <NegativeK> So that, in 50 years, people don't get the reference.
2015-01-14 20:48 <bry> died of aids
2015-01-14 20:48 <bry> and he had it but outlasted the doctor's predictions for decades
2015-01-14 20:48 <`justin> NegativeK: don't worry, i can make sure that people will still get the reference by the time you die
2015-01-14 20:49 <NegativeK> Maybe people will never give up on the reference.
2015-01-14 20:49 <bry> I think he was fueled by spite
2015-01-14 20:49 <agocs> NegativeK: "And finally, to my darling grandson Everett Junior the Third, I am never going to give you up. I am never going to let you down. I am never going to run around, and desert you."
2015-01-14 20:49 <`justin> NegativeK: they wouldn't want to let you down
2015-01-14 20:49 <bry> But we used to visit him
2015-01-14 20:49 <kuroishi> I want my bones made into a chopper and rode around by everyone at my funeral.
2015-01-14 20:49 <bry> and he would take our car to go out on the town
2015-01-14 20:49 <bry> without us
2015-01-14 20:49 <`justin> kuroishi: needs more bones
2015-01-14 20:49 <NegativeK> kuroishi: We can do this now.
2015-01-14 20:49 <NegativeK> Give me your legs.
2015-01-14 20:49 <agocs> kuroishi: I'm going to need about three femurs
2015-01-14 20:50 <NegativeK> Hey, the pedals can be your feet bones!
2015-01-14 20:50 <bry> my mom wants to be hooked up to animatronics
2015-01-14 20:50 <kuroishi> that would be awesome.
2015-01-14 20:50 <bry> and have a disco ball in her hearse
2015-01-14 20:50 <`justin> bry: that's creepy
2015-01-14 20:50 <kuroishi> bry: that's creepier than a bone chopper.
2015-01-14 20:50 <sylphiae> you have an interesting family, bry
2015-01-14 20:50 <`justin> and awesome
2015-01-14 20:50 <NegativeK> My mom and her friend want my dad's head to be frozen so he can come back and cook for them when the technology's available.
2015-01-14 20:50 <kuroishi> also creepier than bone chopper.

2015-01-14 20:59 <agocs> sylphiae: Back in the day when people owned farms, watermelon was considered a poor-person food
2015-01-14 20:59 <bry> you don't even have a paved road to your house
2015-01-14 20:59 <NegativeK> Well, I've seen rednecks have a watermelon seed spitting contest.
2015-01-14 20:59 <kuroishi> yeah it's a classic racial stereo type, watermelon and fried chicken, etc
2015-01-14 20:59 <bry> and you have to run up the nearest hill to get cell reception if anyone tried to kill you

2015-01-14 21:01 <kuroishi> So, my mom was born in indiana to a very young mother who put her up for adoption.
2015-01-14 21:02 <kuroishi> This young mother's brother in law tried to adopt her but the state of indiana declined
2015-01-14 21:02 <kuroishi> As it turns out, said brother in law had already had quite a few adopted kids
2015-01-14 21:02 <kuroishi> so my mom was adopted by another family
2015-01-14 21:03 <kuroishi> turns out the brother in law was somewhat notorious

2015-01-14 21:11 <kuroishi> I've never actually fact checked my moms story =P
2015-01-14 21:11 <NegativeK> Should I call it Machine Shop Office Hours to reclaim the original use of office hours and confuse the fuck out of everyone?
2015-01-14 21:11 <kuroishi> yeah
2015-01-14 21:11 <`justin> lol
2015-01-14 21:11 <t_j> CUNTS

2015-01-14 21:12 <NegativeK> Math Office Hours kicked it off. Then Python. Auths came in around when EEYOO did and started calling themselves Office Hours.

2015-01-14 21:13 <bjonnh> how could that happen on a machine which is not accessible from the outside
2015-01-14 21:13 <kuroishi> It's misleading to announce open office hours on the calendar and have it be a closed event to members seeking certification
2015-01-14 21:13 <greetermon> and confuse the fuck out of "space" for storing
2015-01-14 21:13 <agocs> t_j: That sucks, bro

2015-01-14 21:16 <bjonnh> so how can this machine access my server?
2015-01-14 21:16 <kuroishi> NegativeK: WHO SAID I WAS UNSAFELY SWEEPING THATS NOT FAIR CALL ME ON SKYPE.
2015-01-14 21:17 <NegativeK> I DEMAND INSTRUCTIONS ON THE BROOM TO INDICATE PROPER SWEEPING SAFETY
2015-01-14 21:17 <kuroishi> I'M BEING TARGETED JUST BECAUSE I SWEEP DIFFERENTLY FROM OTHER MEMBERS
2015-01-14 21:17 <t_j> kuroishi: sorry that was me, we need a sign for the broom
2015-01-14 21:17 <kuroishi> Why isn't this broom documented?
2015-01-14 21:17 <NegativeK> USING A DUST MOP AS A WET MOP IS TOTALLY APPROPRIATE DON'T YOU CORRECT ME
2015-01-14 21:17 <agocs> I WAS ON DRUGS, SO THAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED MY SWEEPING
2015-01-14 21:17 <kuroishi> HAHAHA

2015-01-14 21:17 <`justin> I'm going to change the way I run sweeping office hours to address some of these common issues that one dumb person had
2015-01-14 21:18 <t_j> ACTION still wants to stensile "IF YOU CAN'T READ THIS SWEEP THE FUCKING FLOOR" all over teh shop floor
2015-01-14 21:18 <NegativeK> I HAD SEX IN THE DUST PAN, BUT THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM
2015-01-14 21:18 <kuroishi> IT WAS EXCELLENT

2015-01-14 21:18 <NegativeK> o.o
2015-01-14 21:19 <bjonnh> and now I find that the machine is routed to a public ip

2015-01-14 21:20 <kuroishi> /etc/hosts.allow
2015-01-14 21:20 <kuroishi> or iptables
2015-01-14 21:21 <asl2> disable arp - it does a bit more than what you asked
2015-01-14 21:21 <misterbonnie> even sshd conf will do it
2015-01-14 21:22 <kuroishi> ^
2015-01-14 21:23 <bjonnh> well I'd like the services to just answer to addresses in the 10.x.x.x range
2015-01-14 21:23 <asl2> set outbound TTL to 1?
2015-01-14 21:24 <misterbonnie> then iptables, firewalld, tcpwrappers take your pick
2015-01-14 21:24 <bry> there is a dog stuck on the ice of the lake
2015-01-14 21:24 <asl2> locking to addresses sounds easier than ensuring you don't go through any L3 routers
2015-01-14 21:24 <misterbonnie> xinetd
2015-01-14 21:24 <kuroishi> asl2: lol
2015-01-14 21:24 <bry> the entire office has stopped working
2015-01-14 21:24 <kuroishi> onoes
2015-01-14 21:25 <bry> there are 11 emergency vehicles
2015-01-14 21:25 <kuroishi> poor dog
2015-01-14 21:25 <bry> so lsd might be a bit slow
2015-01-14 21:25 <agocs> dangit
2015-01-14 21:25 <agocs> I would have a great view of the chaos from my apartment
2015-01-14 21:25 <bry> some of my coworkers are complaining about tax dollars
2015-01-14 21:26 <bjonnh> asl2: L3?
2015-01-14 21:26 <kuroishi> level3, a major upstream carrier
2015-01-14 21:26 <bjonnh> bry: what happens?
2015-01-14 21:26 <kuroishi> them and comcast have lots of fiber around here
2015-01-14 21:26 <asl2> I thought L3 was IP and L2 would be bridges working at the MAC level
2015-01-14 21:26 <kuroishi> oooh I thought you were referring to L3 the ISP
2015-01-14 21:27 <kuroishi> which yeah, it's hard to route your traffic selectively through top level carriers =P
2015-01-14 21:27 <asl2> L1 would be purely physical-level like an ethernet repeater
2015-01-14 21:28 <hef> new transaction type: 
2015-01-14 21:30 <bry> it's walking across the ice?
2015-01-14 21:31 <bry> there is a boat 
2015-01-14 21:32 <Toba> new transaction type: greetermon 
2015-01-14 21:32 <agocs> Unfortinately, I worry a boat would break the ice that the dog is on
2015-01-14 21:32 <NegativeK> Damn it, bry.
2015-01-14 21:32 <NegativeK> Snapchat is fun stuff, not dogs stuck on the ice. =(
2015-01-14 21:33 <bry> and a helicopter
2015-01-14 21:33 <agocs> a hovercraft
2015-01-14 21:33 <NegativeK> Helicopter dog spins his tail and flies away!
2015-01-14 21:33 <NegativeK> s/his/their/
2015-01-14 21:34 <`justin> bry: some of your coworkers are assholes...
2015-01-14 21:34 <bry> yeah
2015-01-14 21:34 <bry> the dog isn't really cooperating
2015-01-14 21:35 <sylphiae> meh
2015-01-14 21:35 <sylphiae> i would let it die 
2015-01-14 21:35 <bry> and instead is going in a very diagonal direction towards shore
2015-01-14 21:35 <sylphiae> it is a lot of effort for a dog
2015-01-14 21:35 <`justin> O.O
2015-01-14 21:35 <NegativeK> sylphiae does not see the utility in letting the dog live.
2015-01-14 21:36 <sylphiae> ACTION may just not like dogs...
2015-01-14 21:36 <kuroishi> if sylphiae was trapped out there, I'd be like "That's a lot of effort for sylphiae"
2015-01-14 21:36 <agocs> In sylphiae's cold calculus, she would see 75% of earth's population extinguished
2015-01-14 21:36 <kuroishi> =P
2015-01-14 21:36 <sylphiae> i knew someone was gonna say that:P 
2015-01-14 21:36 <NegativeK> >= 75% of the earth's population is on fire?!
2015-01-14 21:36 <`justin> would help with overpopulation :-P
2015-01-14 21:36 <`justin> NegativeK: no, they're stuck out on the ice
2015-01-14 21:36 <`justin> and of low utility apparently
2015-01-14 21:36 <sylphiae> agocs: no, i'm biased towards people and against dogs
2015-01-14 21:37 <NegativeK> Then why extinguish them?
2015-01-14 21:37 <Toba> jenny "ayn rand" tong
2015-01-14 21:37 <NegativeK> Sounds like a waste of fire extinguisher.
2015-01-14 21:37 <NegativeK> Jenny Ayn Rand Paul Ryan Tong.
2015-01-14 21:37 <Toba> ^
2015-01-14 21:37 <kuroishi> I'm biased against australians, but I've made an exception in your case =P
2015-01-14 21:37 <skay> my vpn won't stay connected and I'm at ps1. it seems correlated
2015-01-14 21:37 <`justin> didn't ayn rand like cats?
2015-01-14 21:37 <hef1> skay: what kind of vpn?
2015-01-14 21:37 <sylphiae> aw, that's overly harsh
2015-01-14 21:37 <sylphiae> yeah we had that cat discussion recently
2015-01-14 21:38 <`justin> i seem to recall reading some letters she wrote to cat fancy magazine
2015-01-14 21:38 <`justin> about how cats were objectively useful or something
2015-01-14 21:38 <Toba> ^
2015-01-14 21:38 <Toba> yeah
2015-01-14 21:38 <Toba> but not dogs
2015-01-14 21:38 <skay> hef1: sorry for being completely clueless about what kind of vpn. how can I tell?
2015-01-14 21:38 <`justin> well
2015-01-14 21:38 <`justin> ayn rand said so
2015-01-14 21:38 <`justin> so it must be true, right?
2015-01-14 21:38 <Toba> yes
2015-01-14 21:38 <Toba> clearly
2015-01-14 21:38 <skay> do you guys need hte ayn rand cat url?
2015-01-14 21:38 <hef1> What client do you run to connect to your vpn?
2015-01-14 21:38 <`justin> after all
2015-01-14 21:38 <`justin> i've heard her name before
2015-01-14 21:38 <NegativeK> Them some big ass-taps. http://www.bidspotter.com/en-us/auction-catalogues/heath-industrial/catalogue-id-bsche10136/lot-00339531-ff5a-422b-be1f-a42000f480af
2015-01-14 21:38 <misterbonnie> oh god ayn rand
2015-01-14 21:38 <kuroishi> NegativeK: I'd tap dat
2015-01-14 21:39 <hef1> Iv'e seen some MS clients that will break if there are 2 people connecting from behind the same NAT
2015-01-14 21:39 <NegativeK> Oh, my god Ayn Rand.
2015-01-14 21:39 <misterbonnie> don't marry an adult human super into ayn rand
2015-01-14 21:39 <skay> hef1: whatever the ubuntu thing is that has an icon up there in my bar
2015-01-14 21:39 <misterbonnie> ACTION personal experience
2015-01-14 21:39 <sylphiae> what
2015-01-14 21:39 <sylphiae> i'm not sure what that means? 
2015-01-14 21:39 <hef1> Sadly, that is all of them
2015-01-14 21:39 <`justin> http://www.businessinsider.com/ayn-rands-letter-to-cat-fancy-magazine-2014-6
2015-01-14 21:39 <`justin> skay: ^
2015-01-14 21:39 <sylphiae> ohh  nm
2015-01-14 21:39 <Toba> haha
2015-01-14 21:39 <Toba> misterbonnie: im sorry
2015-01-14 21:39 <NegativeK> I might be able to handle someone into Ayn Rand.
2015-01-14 21:39 <sylphiae> i thought you meant creating some kind of ayn rand super-being
2015-01-14 21:39 <NegativeK> But not "super into".
2015-01-14 21:40 <skay> hef1: I don't know how to answer the question, I can try figuring it out later
2015-01-14 21:40 <misterbonnie> Toba: it is ok
2015-01-14 21:40 <NegativeK> sylphiae: It was already done.
2015-01-14 21:40 <misterbonnie> now
2015-01-14 21:40 <Toba> oh, i know
2015-01-14 21:40 <greetermon> hear doctors are saying that's bad for you now
2015-01-14 21:40 <`justin> sylphiae: don't mention the super ayn rand!
2015-01-14 21:40 <skay> CarlFK: hey what is this thing called?
2015-01-14 21:40 <NegativeK> Ayn Rand was born. She has since, however, ridden to heaven on a white horse.
2015-01-14 21:40 <skay> I bet CarlFK knows
2015-01-14 21:40 <`justin> you'll just give her more power!
2015-01-14 21:40 <Toba> super ayn rand: doctos say it's bad for you.
2015-01-14 21:40 <skay> ACTION loves all the ayn rand related articles on the-toast
2015-01-14 21:40 <misterbonnie> she would have hated hacker spaces
2015-01-14 21:40 <NegativeK> Dat feed rate: http://www.bidspotter.com/en-us/auction-catalogues/heath-industrial/catalogue-id-bsche10136/lot-55d6f56a-b885-400f-ba6c-a42000f480b8
2015-01-14 21:40 <agocs> super ayn rand: More objectivism with half the calories
2015-01-14 21:40 <Toba> the toast is great.
2015-01-14 21:40 <kuroishi> I haven't read any rand, I'm worried that I will like it to much and become a raging objectivist asshole, rather than just a raging asshole with no moral or political basis.
2015-01-14 21:41 <misterbonnie> she would have hated the toast
2015-01-14 21:41 <skay> misterbonnie: hehehe
2015-01-14 21:41 <Toba> fact: I've been following mallory ortberg since before the toast was launched #hipsterbrag
2015-01-14 21:41 <NegativeK> Hate is objectively uesful.
2015-01-14 21:41 <misterbonnie> me 2 Toba 
2015-01-14 21:41 <sylphiae> i don't think you would like it, unless you are a sociopath:P 
2015-01-14 21:41 <Toba> i saw her book
2015-01-14 21:41 <skay> we use it to power the dark satanic mills
2015-01-14 21:41 <Toba> in a bookstore in maine
2015-01-14 21:41 <skay> hate
2015-01-14 21:41 <Toba> i almost bought it
2015-01-14 21:41 <Toba> but... i didnt get most of the references
2015-01-14 21:41 <Toba> because i'm not literary enough
2015-01-14 21:41 <misterbonnie> Toba: that's what i'm afraid of
2015-01-14 21:41 <Toba> so it felt like a waste of money
2015-01-14 21:41 <Toba> i mean
2015-01-14 21:41 <skay> I think I read mostg of The Fountainhead? and parts of Atlas Shrugged
2015-01-14 21:41 <bry> reporting that there is more than 1 helicopter
2015-01-14 21:41 <skay> stupid science fiction
2015-01-14 21:42 <Toba> all it will do is remind us that we aren't sas glorious as mallory   
2015-01-14 21:42 <Toba> which we know already
2015-01-14 21:42 <Toba> so
2015-01-14 21:42 <Toba> meh
2015-01-14 21:42 <misterbonnie> did you know she was on jeopardy
2015-01-14 21:42 <skay> bry: helecopter where?
2015-01-14 21:42 <bry> to rescue the dog
2015-01-14 21:42 <bry> I'm at lake shore drive and chicago
2015-01-14 21:42 <kuroishi> a serbian drove his pedicab into the lake once
2015-01-14 21:42 <skay> wow I am so slacking off. I meant to write some stupid illinformed shell script to check upstart to see that gunicorn is running and then have nagios call it or something
2015-01-14 21:43 <`justin> i read anthem once
2015-01-14 21:43 <Toba> i did not misterbonnie 
2015-01-14 21:43 <skay> why isn't there a plugin for that?
2015-01-14 21:43 <Toba> vidlink asap
2015-01-14 21:43 <skay> or something
2015-01-14 21:43 <NegativeK> kuroishi: If he was Siberian, he wouldn't notice.
2015-01-14 21:43 <kuroishi> cost him like 4000 to get it out with a police boat
2015-01-14 21:43 <`justin> i'm pretty sure i stole it, so i'm doing it right, right?
2015-01-14 21:43 <kuroishi> lol
2015-01-14 21:43 <NegativeK> Jesus.
2015-01-14 21:43 <NegativeK> Who's going to pay for the dog?
2015-01-14 21:43 <kuroishi> better start a crowdfunding campaign
2015-01-14 21:44 <NegativeK> Puppiegogo.
2015-01-14 21:44 <`justin> 2 helicopters does seem a bit excessive for a dog
2015-01-14 21:44 <kuroishi> one is probably just a news helicopter
2015-01-14 21:44 <`justin> is this like the one dog that ayn rand said was objectively useful?
2015-01-14 21:44 <`justin> kuroishi: good point
2015-01-14 21:44 <`justin> forgot to ask that
2015-01-14 21:44 <NegativeK> It's a helicopter sent by sylphiae. A mews helicopter.
2015-01-14 21:45 <`justin> bry: are these helicopters actually helping the rescue or merely recording it?
2015-01-14 21:45 <`justin> sylphiae's helicopter is loaded with missles and gatling guns
2015-01-14 21:45 <NegativeK> Live feed from Channel 5, where we've got 8 hours coverage of a dog freezing to death in the lake.
2015-01-14 21:45 <bry> the dog has advanced out of the site that can be achieved through the windows near my cube
2015-01-14 21:45 <bry> *sight
2015-01-14 21:45 <NegativeK> bry: Mirror.
2015-01-14 21:45 <NegativeK> Or look in the reflection of the spider eyes that are outside your window.

2015-01-14 21:46 <NegativeK> I almost typed it. =(

2015-01-14 21:47 <sylphiae> also, i would prefer mills-like utilitarianism NegativeK
2015-01-14 21:47 <skay> the doorbell just rang.
2015-01-14 21:47 <`justin> skay: we know
2015-01-14 21:47 <skay> I am ignoring it since there is nothing open right now
2015-01-14 21:47 <skay> or is there?
2015-01-14 21:47 -!- Warped(~Warped@108.85.160.119) has joined #pumpingstationone
2015-01-14 21:47 <`justin> we were going to let them in
2015-01-14 21:47 <skay> oh hey, look at zirc
2015-01-14 21:47 <NegativeK> skay: You answer it, you're responsible for the guest.
2015-01-14 21:47 <`justin> but then we didn't
2015-01-14 21:47 <`justin> and by we, i mean NegativeK 
2015-01-14 21:47 <skay> yeah, I'm ignoring them
2015-01-14 21:47 <sylphiae> man, if i had a gatling gun loaded helicopter...i dunno what i'd do
2015-01-14 21:47 <NegativeK> Start by killing the poor people.
2015-01-14 21:48 <agocs> That's tweetable as hell
2015-01-14 21:48 <NegativeK> Wait, too soon?
2015-01-14 21:48 <agocs> dammit sudlowbot
2015-01-14 21:48 <`justin> !tweet < NegativeK> Start by killing the poor people.
2015-01-14 21:48 <skay> you can tweet by hand you know
2015-01-14 21:48 <skay> hand crafted artisanal tweets
2015-01-14 21:48 <kuroishi> "How do you kill women and children? Easy! Just don't lead 'em so much!"
2015-01-14 21:48 <`justin> suuuuudloooooowboooooooot!!!!!!!!!!
2015-01-14 21:48 <agocs> Not as Sudlowbot
2015-01-14 21:48 <`justin> skay: that would probably require me to create a twitter account of some kind
2015-01-14 21:49 <loans> many xray
2015-01-14 21:49 <`justin> i only utilize the twittervers via bots
2015-01-14 21:49 <NegativeK> Such irradiated.

2015-01-15 06:10 <Toba> stranding 1 trillion dogs on lake michigan is hugely negative
2015-01-15 06:10 <Toba> 1 is positive
2015-01-15 06:10 <Toba> it has to cross the line somewhere

2015-01-15 16:21 <t_j> it is still just about breakfast time after all

2015-01-15 16:26 <`justin> sylphiae: breakfast will come for you soon enough
2015-01-15 16:28 <DoormanDave> loans: when I joined I assumed it was just rotated (more frequently than it is)
2015-01-15 16:28 <loans> we last rotated it in march 2013
2015-01-15 16:29 <Toba> rotated what
2015-01-15 16:29 <`justin> t_j: nice vid :-)
2015-01-15 16:29 <loans> i THINK we've probably seen the last of the people who never read the email
2015-01-15 16:29 <DoormanDave> door code
2015-01-15 16:29 <loans> but
2015-01-15 16:29 <loans> i am likely wrong
2015-01-15 16:29 <DoormanDave> lol
2015-01-15 16:29 <loans> i spent six months regularly telling people that yes, we changed it. yes, you were emailed
2015-01-15 16:29 <Toba> lol
2015-01-15 16:29 <Toba> rfid is going to save us all!
2015-01-15 16:29 <loans> another 2-3 doing it infrequently
2015-01-15 16:29 <Toba> as soon as beaglebones stop dying!
2015-01-15 16:29 <Toba> loans
2015-01-15 16:29 <Toba> what FS are you using on the beagles?
2015-01-15 16:29 <DoormanDave> beaglebone(s)?
2015-01-15 16:29 <loans> probably ext4?
2015-01-15 16:29 <Toba> ext4 doesn't do wearleveling
2015-01-15 16:29 <loans> i could check
2015-01-15 16:29 <DoormanDave> have we killed multiple?
2015-01-15 16:30 <Toba> i hear btrfs is way better
2015-01-15 16:30 <Toba> at not killing sd cards
2015-01-15 16:30 <Toba> from a guy who does embedded shit for a living
2015-01-15 16:30 <Toba> bbl meeting
2015-01-15 16:30 <loans> Toba: whatever the default debian image does. the flash controller should be doing wear leveling
2015-01-15 16:30 <loans> doing it again at filesystem level is usually stupid, is my understanding
2015-01-15 16:30 <NegativeK> They should fight.
2015-01-15 16:30 <loans> which is why you see f2fs
2015-01-15 16:30 <loans> specifically designed to take advantage of flash memory controllers
2015-01-15 16:31 <DoormanDave> loans: did you accept your new job yet?
2015-01-15 16:31 <loans> DoormanDave: phone call in about an hour to discuss an offer
2015-01-15 16:31 <DoormanDave> nice
2015-01-15 16:31 <NegativeK> loans: o/
2015-01-15 16:31 <DoormanDave> \o /tmp/psql.out
2015-01-15 16:32 <`justin> i think the door code change would have been march 2014
2015-01-15 16:32 <`justin> not 2013
2015-01-15 16:32 <loans> yeah, that's what i meant
2015-01-15 16:32 <`justin> i was definitely a member when that happened
2015-01-15 16:32 <loans> the rest of my statement stands
2015-01-15 16:32 <`justin> loans: yeah, i know
2015-01-15 16:32 <`justin> just participating in Pedantic Station: One :-)
2015-01-15 16:32 <loans> it's such a fuckin hassle i don't even want to rotate it again
2015-01-15 16:32 <loans> until we've had a big fucking bowl full of RFID tags in the entryway
2015-01-15 16:32 <loans> saying "Please use this"
2015-01-15 16:32 <loans> for a few months
2015-01-15 16:32 <hef1> I should rotate the door code, and just have people email bry
2015-01-15 16:33 <loans> haha
2015-01-15 16:33 <NegativeK> Hah!
2015-01-15 16:33 <loans> hahaha
2015-01-15 16:33 <hef1> at her president@ account
2015-01-15 16:33 <NegativeK> Like, right now. So the last few days are "what is the code?!"
2015-01-15 16:33 <DoormanDave> hahaha
2015-01-15 16:33 <hef1> yeah
2015-01-15 16:33 <loans> i'd probably learn the bry school of ignoring email in a couple weeks
2015-01-15 16:33 <hef1> because that question only lasts for 5 days
2015-01-15 16:33 <loans> ooh
2015-01-15 16:33 <hef1> loans: I recommend telling everyone to email info@ all the time
2015-01-15 16:34 <loans> the door code should be listed somewhere on the member site so people have another option for places to ignore
2015-01-15 16:34 <Toba> ^
2015-01-15 16:34 <hef1> loans: makes sense
2015-01-15 16:34 <hef1> do we already have an issue for that?
2015-01-15 16:34 <hef1> we might
2015-01-15 16:34 <NegativeK> !exec |^
2015-01-15 16:34 <DoormanDave> people really aren't good at remembering that
2015-01-15 16:34 <loans> i don't know
2015-01-15 16:34 <Toba> log in is predicated on current member right?
2015-01-15 16:34 <loans> i'll check
2015-01-15 16:34 <hef1> Toba: in theory
2015-01-15 16:34 <DoormanDave> I don't know why, it's simple enough for me.
2015-01-15 16:34 <Toba> ha
2015-01-15 16:34 <Toba> i like how you dont say yes ot things you can't prove hef
2015-01-15 16:34 <Toba> it's a perfect blend of infuriating and honest
2015-01-15 16:34 <hef1> Toba: oh?
2015-01-15 16:35 <loans> hah
2015-01-15 16:35 <`justin> is it possible to have pings on rt that only certain people can see?
2015-01-15 16:35 <hef1> In practice, there have only ever been 3 accounts turned off
2015-01-15 16:35 <Toba> uh
2015-01-15 16:35 <hef1> because I couldn't rely on zoho
2015-01-15 16:35 <Toba> haha!
2015-01-15 16:35 <Toba> hahahah!
2015-01-15 16:35 <hef1> and I only recently moved member management over
2015-01-15 16:35 <Toba> fuck!
2015-01-15 16:36 <DoormanDave> hah
2015-01-15 16:36 <NegativeK> Wait, isn't Toba at a meeting?
2015-01-15 16:36 <Toba> no
2015-01-15 16:36 <Toba> because it got fucked up
2015-01-15 16:36 <`justin> an irc meeting
2015-01-15 16:36 <Toba> and 2 of the guys are stuck
2015-01-15 16:36 <Toba> in another meeting.
2015-01-15 16:36 <DoormanDave> hah
2015-01-15 16:36 <NegativeK> Niiiice.
2015-01-15 16:36 <NegativeK> Meeting prereqs.
2015-01-15 16:36 <loans> `justin: sorta not easy is my understanding
2015-01-15 16:36 <`justin> stuck in a time loop?
2015-01-15 16:36 <DoormanDave> I thought you said "because I got fucked up."
2015-01-15 16:36 <Toba> nice
2015-01-15 16:36 <Toba> they're booked all day
2015-01-15 16:36 <Toba> DoormanDave: I wish I did
2015-01-15 16:37 <DoormanDave> "Yeah I was going to go to the meeting, but now i'm in the bathroom drinking gin."
2015-01-15 16:37 <Toba> ^
2015-01-15 16:37 <Toba> ps, if anyone wants gin, there's a gatorade bottle of not sure what brand gin in my shelf.
2015-01-15 16:37 <Toba> help yourself.
2015-01-15 16:37 <`justin> loans: i guess my vague, maybe not easy, suggestion is to have president@ go to some private queue on rt
2015-01-15 16:37 <DoormanDave> ACTION will
2015-01-15 16:37 <NegativeK> Toba is the man of hackerspace class.
2015-01-15 16:37 <Toba> gatorade gin.
2015-01-15 16:37 <Toba> class.
2015-01-15 16:37 <`justin> and then on the pings that should have gone to info@ instead, just move them in rt
2015-01-15 16:37 <DoormanDave> hah
2015-01-15 16:37 <Toba> i'm not sure you understand.
2015-01-15 16:37 <Toba> what class is.
2015-01-15 16:37 <Toba> it's not gatorade bottle gin
2015-01-15 16:37 <Toba> I know that
2015-01-15 16:37 <DoormanDave> gatorade mystery gin is my sort of class
2015-01-15 16:38 <`justin> but that would only work if it could be done so that only the president could see pings sent to president@
2015-01-15 16:38 <`justin> anyways, it's just an idea
2015-01-15 16:38 <`justin> and i have no idea how to configure rt things
2015-01-15 16:38 <`justin> so it's not like i'm going to do it
2015-01-15 16:39 <DoormanDave> `justin: if you have ways you would like to direct things in RT automagically or settings, email info@ =P
2015-01-15 16:39 <DoormanDave> if you are feeling particularly delagatorius you can assign it to me even
2015-01-15 16:39 <`justin> ACTION shakes fist at DoormanDave 
2015-01-15 16:39 <`justin> DAMN YOU!!!!
2015-01-15 16:39 <DoormanDave> I think I invented a word, but I really like that word
2015-01-15 16:40 <hef1> https://github.com/hef/ps1auth/issues/53
2015-01-15 16:40 <hef1> nie
2015-01-15 16:40 <hef1> nice
2015-01-15 16:40 <NegativeK> So, turns out that A6 tool steel is nearly D2 in terms of "this is awful to machine".
2015-01-15 16:40 <Toba> hef1 - when vagrant upping ps1auth
2015-01-15 16:40 <NegativeK> Which means we have a bucket of $0.50 a pound steel that's some of the toughest stuff to work with that isn't a superalloy. >.>
2015-01-15 16:40 <Toba> have you ever seen python install errors while trying to install distribute?
2015-01-15 16:41 <Toba> that usually means I have to force upgrade easy_install in the vagrant up script right
2015-01-15 16:41 <hef1> I remember seeing warnings
2015-01-15 16:41 <DoormanDave> vagrant provision will usually re-run those steps iirc
2015-01-15 16:41 <Toba> I tried to do this the other night and it got really mean at me
2015-01-15 16:41 <Toba> oh
2015-01-15 16:41 <hef1> and vagrant highlights thigns in red
2015-01-15 16:41 <Toba> I never did provision
2015-01-15 16:41 <hef1> provision should be automatic
2015-01-15 16:41 <Toba> vagrant makes normal errors seem scarier
2015-01-15 16:41 <DoormanDave> up runs them
2015-01-15 16:41 <Toba> yeah, I'll try again tonight I think
2015-01-15 16:42 <DoormanDave> but if you had errors and want to re-run the provisioning steps of the Vagrantfile you can.
2015-01-15 16:42 <Toba> holy fuck
2015-01-15 16:42 <Toba> xmonad does NOT have volume control built in
2015-01-15 16:42 <Toba> i just almost went deaf
2015-01-15 16:42 <DoormanDave> lol
2015-01-15 16:42 <Toba> jesus
2015-01-15 16:42 <DoormanDave> no tiling wms do
2015-01-15 16:42 <Toba> haha
2015-01-15 16:42 <DoormanDave> why do you think us nerds always have alsamixer in a tile
2015-01-15 16:42 <NegativeK> ^
2015-01-15 16:42 <Toba> now i know why NegativeK has alsamixer open 
2015-01-15 16:42 <Toba> ha
2015-01-15 16:42 <Toba> lol
2015-01-15 16:43 <Toba> pulseaudiomixer is such a mouthful.
2015-01-15 16:43 <DoormanDave> lol
2015-01-15 16:43 <DoormanDave> fuck pulseaudio
2015-01-15 16:43 <misterbonnie> ^
2015-01-15 16:43 <loans> ^
2015-01-15 16:43 <Toba> ha
2015-01-15 16:43 <Toba> yup
2015-01-15 16:45 <DoormanDave> bry: you around?
2015-01-15 16:45 <hef1> Toba: there are also bright red warnings about unit tests
2015-01-15 16:45 <hef1> I have not fixed those
2015-01-15 16:45 <Toba> k
2015-01-15 16:45 <hef1> it's not the tests that are broken, it's the test runner
2015-01-15 16:45 <DoormanDave> hef1: bry mentioned you guys did the board handoff meeting at your place last year?
2015-01-15 16:46 <Toba> that did happen
2015-01-15 16:46 <DoormanDave> would you guys be interested in adjourning to a place that is not the space again this year?
2015-01-15 16:47 <DoormanDave> if so, my house is available, and a block away.
2015-01-15 16:49 <DoormanDave> I was able to get ps1auth vagrant running without issue the other day
2015-01-15 16:49 <Toba> neat
2015-01-15 16:49 <Toba> maybe i need to pull a newer version
2015-01-15 16:49 <DoormanDave> nah there were red error
2015-01-15 16:49 <DoormanDave> but everything started okay
2015-01-15 16:49 <Toba> oh yeah i do
2015-01-15 16:50 <Toba> i should do workwork tho
2015-01-15 16:50 <Toba> ACTION afk
2015-01-15 16:50 <Toba> (that's probably a lie)
2015-01-15 16:50 <DoormanDave> yeah hef actually works on it =P
2015-01-15 16:51 <DoormanDave> loans: your github gravatar is dumb
2015-01-15 16:51 <Toba> oh
2015-01-15 16:51 <Toba> my gravatar is great
2015-01-15 16:51 <Toba> hm
2015-01-15 16:52 <Toba> i wonder if ifttt does gravatar
2015-01-15 16:52 <bry> my gravatar is my face
2015-01-15 16:52 <Toba> i set up my ifttt to set my twitter profile pic to my latest instagram every time
2015-01-15 16:52 <loans> what the fuck is a gravatar
2015-01-15 16:52 <`justin> your picture thingy
2015-01-15 16:52 <DoormanDave> the little guys that are supposed to look like space invaders
2015-01-15 16:52 <`justin> that you probably didn't set
2015-01-15 16:52 <DoormanDave> yours looks like a line with some balls
2015-01-15 16:53 <`justin> and probably just have one of the defaults
2015-01-15 16:53 <hef1> the name means "global avatar"  It lets sites look up a profile image on gravatar.com against a hash of your email address
2015-01-15 16:53 <`justin> mine is just a picture of me dressed as a robot for halloween
2015-01-15 16:53 <agocs> hef1: shouldn't it be glavatar then?
2015-01-15 16:53 <DoormanDave> mine is a really cool random space invader
2015-01-15 16:53 <DoormanDave> agocs: it's japanese
2015-01-15 16:53 <hef1> so something like  gravatar.com/avatar/80x80/hash(foo@bar.com).png resolves to an image
2015-01-15 16:54 <bry> glamatar
2015-01-15 16:54 <MichD> loans: gravatar is a service where you can register your email address to associte it with a profile picture
2015-01-15 16:54 <bry> github hooks into it
2015-01-15 16:54 <bry> amongst other things
2015-01-15 16:54 <agocs> bry: I should sign up with glamatar. I assume my avatar will have long hair and sparkes
2015-01-15 16:54 <agocs> sparkles
2015-01-15 16:54 <MichD> so if you sign up somewhere with your email address, they can grab an avatar from there if you've got it set up, so they don't need their own avatar upload bullshit
2015-01-15 16:54 <`justin> note that this service isn't all that useful if you register for every website with a different email address
2015-01-15 16:55 <DoormanDave> agocs: long hair and sparks is bad, keep that shit tied up in hot metals
2015-01-15 16:55 <MichD> you can use different email addresses with one gravatar account though
2015-01-15 16:55 <`justin> MichD: sounds like more work than i'm willing to care about just to have my picture on things
2015-01-15 16:56 <`justin> i'm surprised i ever even did it for github
2015-01-15 16:56 <skay> bjonnh: yes, it is also secretions. I meant to make a joke based on that. here is the history behind it http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism#Phlegm
2015-01-15 16:56 <DoormanDave> Toba: you should set up lolcommits, and have that automatically be your twitter profile pic
2015-01-15 16:56 <Toba> ha
2015-01-15 16:56 <Toba> nice
2015-01-15 16:56 <DoormanDave> lolcommits is the best
2015-01-15 16:56 <Toba> lolcommits should be pretty great
2015-01-15 16:57 <skay> ACTION fines paid
2015-01-15 16:57 <DoormanDave> we should have more lolcommits at things like the rfid hackathon
2015-01-15 16:57 <DoormanDave> and put them on the blog
2015-01-15 16:57 <DoormanDave> =P
2015-01-15 16:57 <skay> now I just have to pay for parking all day until the boot comes off
2015-01-15 16:57 <DoormanDave> or at least the twitter
2015-01-15 16:57 <DoormanDave> wait what?
2015-01-15 16:58 <DoormanDave> skay: or what? they'll fine you again since you haven't moved your car since it's still booted?
2015-01-15 16:58 <skay> any time from now until 10pm
2015-01-15 16:58 <hef1> one of mine: https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e8b98ce52adf41274e2e926ea8d81875
2015-01-15 16:58 <DoormanDave> fucking privatized parking
2015-01-15 16:58 <DoormanDave> that is insane
2015-01-15 16:59 <loans> DoormanDave: check my profile now
2015-01-15 16:59 <loans> i added an image just for you
2015-01-15 16:59 <loans> and learned how to use my webcam to capture images at the same time
2015-01-15 16:59 <bry> um
2015-01-15 16:59 <Toba> lies
2015-01-15 16:59 <Toba> hi bry.
2015-01-15 16:59 <DoormanDave> and you can't just be like "Pay all day" can you?  You have to go back to your booted car that you've already paid for and pay more every 3 hours?
2015-01-15 17:00 <DoormanDave> talk about adding insult to injury
2015-01-15 17:00 <DoormanDave> that's fucked.
2015-01-15 17:00 <NegativeK> loans: I decided on a name for Thursday machining thing: Deus Ex Machining.
2015-01-15 17:01 <agocs> I can live with that
2015-01-15 17:01 <NegativeK> agocs: Lathe tool blanks on my shelf. loans: Lathe tool blanks on your shelf.
2015-01-15 17:01 <agocs> grazi, NegativeK 
2015-01-15 17:01 <DoormanDave> oh shit, I was gonna leave something on my shelf for agocs 
2015-01-15 17:01 <NegativeK> Grazi for reducing shipping and saving the earf a little. >.>
2015-01-15 17:01 <DoormanDave> what was it
2015-01-15 17:02 <NegativeK> Love.
2015-01-15 17:02 <NegativeK> Poop?

2015-01-15 17:24 <DoormanDave> I should get dockerbot rollin'
2015-01-15 17:25 <DoormanDave> Nonebot is actually dockerbot because I didn't have a simpler python bot handy
2015-01-15 17:25 <DoormanDave> with all of it's code removed
2015-01-15 17:25 <loans> man. they're renting all 16 of our 3515s to the joffrey for a while, starting at the end of the month

2015-01-15 17:26 <Toba> good thing you're getting the fuck out eh
2015-01-15 17:26 <ieIe> Is there a simple way of making one?
2015-01-15 17:26 <DoormanDave> better order some more.
2015-01-15 17:26 <Toba> better burn down the building and flee into the distance cackling
2015-01-15 17:26 <hef1> ieIe: indeed

2015-01-15 17:30 <greetermon> plugin for discourse which offers auth0 support, it's some sort of auth integration framework that works with AD
2015-01-15 17:30 <loans> they're glass in the 3515
2015-01-15 17:31 <loans> ieIe: if you're even vaguely familiar with python, you can have a bot up and running in a few minutes. there's lots of existing libraries that will handle all the IRC stuff, and give you hooks to do 'bot' stuff on top of it
2015-01-15 17:31 <Toba> that's one of the reasons there are so many here.
2015-01-15 17:31 <Toba> they are easy projects and fun.
2015-01-15 17:31 <Toba> and they quickly can interact with you and people get to see your project.

2015-01-15 18:13 <DoormanDave> are we gonna have some symposium on code for the space/thingsbus?

2015-01-15 18:24 <Toba> wait
2015-01-15 18:24 <Toba> there was yelling and commit reversion?
2015-01-15 18:24 <DoormanDave> no

2015-01-15 18:24 <bry> i linked

2015-01-15 18:25 <Toba> lol
2015-01-15 18:25 <Toba> good idea
2015-01-15 18:25 <DoormanDave> =P
2015-01-15 18:25 <Toba> do we have anything for invoking neurons, hef1
2015-01-15 18:25 <DoormanDave> not my idea.
2015-01-15 18:26 <Toba> it would be nice to have a dockerbot type thing for that

2015-01-15 18:26 <Toba> !addneuron git_url

2015-01-15 18:26 <Toba> yay
2015-01-15 18:26 <DoormanDave> that was the feature I wanted to add next

2015-01-15 18:27 <Toba> hm
2015-01-15 18:27 <Toba> we should make our ldap have a field for github username
2015-01-15 18:27 <DoormanDave> that'd be cool
2015-01-15 18:27 <Toba> i think you see where i'm going w/that?
2015-01-15 18:27 <Toba> make it so it can check if the repo is under a member's account
2015-01-15 18:27 <Toba> and if so, it'll just say okay
2015-01-15 18:28 <Toba> as 'security'

2015-01-15 19:36 <skay__> you get tangles with long hair
2015-01-15 19:36 <skay__> I just cut them out

2015-01-15 19:38 <DoormanDave> i've punched the hell out of some software
2015-01-15 19:39 <NegativeK> I need to make a cold chisel that has a cone wider than 1/2".
2015-01-15 19:39 <DoormanDave> I printed out buggy sql migration code and burned it.
2015-01-15 19:39 <DoormanDave> after having to repair lots of the damage manually
2015-01-15 19:39 <DoormanDave> "Lets go in the alley and burn this code."
2015-01-15 19:39 <NegativeK> Er, cold punch? Whatever. Center punch.
2015-01-15 19:39 <Nerobro> half inch?
2015-01-15 19:40 <Nerobro> thjat's huge
2015-01-15 19:40 <NegativeK> Yup.
2015-01-15 19:40 <Nerobro> what do you need that for?
2015-01-15 19:40 <NegativeK> I wanna deform the threads at the bottom of some t-nuts so people can't crank the rod into the slot.
2015-01-15 19:40 <loans> something dumb
2015-01-15 19:40 <NegativeK> Not necessary, but a good to have.
2015-01-15 19:40 <Nerobro> NegativeK, that doesn't seem like a good way of doing that..
2015-01-15 19:40 <DoormanDave> NegativeK: plasma.
2015-01-15 19:40 <t_j> NegativeK: just weld a lump in the bottom

2015-01-15 19:40 <Nerobro> for a bunch of reasons.
2015-01-15 19:41 <NegativeK> Nerobro: It's not uncommon. And the t-nuts aren't heat treated yet. >.>
2015-01-15 19:41 <NegativeK> I like how t_j and DoormanDave said basically the same thing.
2015-01-15 19:41 <Nerobro> I like the welding option.
2015-01-15 19:41 <DoormanDave> "burn it"
2015-01-15 19:41 <Nerobro> I can think of a bunch of other options too
2015-01-15 19:41 <DoormanDave> jbweld =P
2015-01-15 19:41 <Nerobro> hell, take a bolt, cut a little slice off, and locktite that in the bottom
2015-01-15 19:42 <Nerobro> by deforming the threads, you're going to hurt your studs.
2015-01-15 19:42 <t_j> NegativeK: thats because DoormanDave and my are smarter than you :P
2015-01-15 19:42 <Nerobro> someone WILL try to drive the stud through
2015-01-15 19:42 <t_j> *me
2015-01-15 19:42 <NegativeK> I'm okay with wrecked studs.
2015-01-15 19:42 <NegativeK> Huhuh.
2015-01-15 19:42 <loans> those studs can suck it

2015-01-15 19:47 <NegativeK> I'm hesitant to consume much of the bottom of the threads, as there isn't much metal except at the bottom.
2015-01-15 19:48 <DoormanDave> so add more metal
2015-01-15 19:48 <NegativeK> Just weld the t-nut into the Bridgeport slot.

2015-01-15 19:51 <DoormanDave> bigger table? plus then you can clamp the welder to it and weld while your milling!

2015-01-15 20:09 <bry> a good place to start is to start by creating a ponytail (with tie) and just tilt your head to the side
2015-01-15 20:10 <bry> if you already know how to create a basic 3 part braid, that is
2015-01-15 20:10 <bry> after that, I taught myself how to do it behind my head

2015-01-15 20:35 <NegativeK> Told Dean about the 4'6" radial arm drill press. His response: "Too small."
2015-01-15 20:36 <loans> hah
2015-01-15 20:36 <loans> and also hah
2015-01-15 20:37 <loans> my expectation is CM will address minimum comolaint and sullenly install office
2015-01-15 20:37 <loans> owner was shocked i dont have excel
2015-01-15 20:37 <bry> Someone just asked me if we could use varchar instead of a PK of a table
2015-01-15 20:38 <agocs> they work about the same
2015-01-15 20:38 <agocs> varchar, primary ket
2015-01-15 20:38 <agocs> key
2015-01-15 20:38 <bry> no, no
2015-01-15 20:38 <bry> like
2015-01-15 20:38 <agocs> six one way, half a dozen the other
2015-01-15 20:38 <bry> they wanted to store the username in varchar
2015-01-15 20:38 <bry> instead of the PK of the user's table
2015-01-15 20:38 <bry> it would be hand entered
2015-01-15 20:38 <agocs> Shoudn't the user's PK be a GUID or something?
2015-01-15 20:39 <bry> we use incrementing ints
2015-01-15 20:39 <agocs> ok, cool
2015-01-15 20:39 <agocs> Wait, they wanted to use the username as a PK?
2015-01-15 20:39 <bry> We were discussing inserting rows into a different gable
2015-01-15 20:40 <bry> *table
2015-01-15 20:40 <Toba> anne of green tables, a story of an orphaned database row
2015-01-15 20:40 <agocs> ohhhhhhhh
2015-01-15 20:40 <Toba> with no references and no read queries in years
2015-01-15 20:40 <agocs> So they wanted the foreign key to be the username instead of the pk
2015-01-15 20:40 <bry> Yeah
2015-01-15 20:40 <agocs> fuck your coworker
2015-01-15 20:40 <agocs> not in the sexy way
2015-01-15 20:41 <bry> He doesn't understand and I told him no
2015-01-15 20:41 <Toba> you 'can' use a varchar as a primary key
2015-01-15 20:41 <bry> and that he needs to use the PK
2015-01-15 20:41 <Toba> but it isn't a good idea
2015-01-15 20:41 <Toba> it's not as performant as using integer keys
2015-01-15 20:41 <t_j> varchar is devilspawn and should never be used for anything
2015-01-15 20:41 <bry> we don't use FK constraints
2015-01-15 20:41 <Toba> and then you can't edit the username
2015-01-15 20:41 <Toba> without a bunch of problems
2015-01-15 20:41 <agocs> t_j: nvarchar is so much better
2015-01-15 20:41 <t_j> agocs: or just char.....
2015-01-15 20:41 <agocs> just stick everything into a blob
2015-01-15 20:42 <t_j> agocs: varchar size is defined in bytes not in chars
2015-01-15 20:42 <t_j> then start sticking utf8 wide chars in your db and start wonding why you have strange truncation
2015-01-15 20:43 <agocs> t_j: Does nvarchar perform that correction for you?
2015-01-15 20:43 <agocs> It's been a minute since I thought about MS Sql Server
2015-01-15 20:44 <t_j> nvarchar has the same problem
2015-01-15 20:44 <hef1> I had a postgres friend that complaind the mysql truncated too
2015-01-15 20:45 <hef1> he claimed postgres raises an error
2015-01-15 20:45 <t_j> use nchar/char and waist some storage, but with reliable truncation
2015-01-15 20:45 <t_j> hef1: yeah varchar in mysql is bobins
2015-01-15 20:45 <agocs> According to http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms176089.aspx, varchar is non-unicode only. Can you still cram whatever characters you want in there?
2015-01-15 20:45 <hef1> I spent a couple weeks (in total) making sqlite play nice
2015-01-15 20:46 <hef1> blob time?
2015-01-15 20:46 <t_j> agocs: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms186939.aspx
2015-01-15 20:46 <bry> I make a table in dev and ask the dba to recreate in prod
2015-01-15 20:46 <bry> and get a lecture about how I'm doing it wrong
2015-01-15 20:46 <hef1> agocs: so unicode versus not unicode is difficult to define
2015-01-15 20:46 <hef1> IF it allows extended codepages, which it probably does, there isn't a good way to tell the difference between utf8 and ANSI
2015-01-15 20:47 <bry> and then one day they asked me about indexes
2015-01-15 20:47 <bry> and I blinked for a really long time
2015-01-15 20:47 <t_j> there is a reason all windows internal strings are encoded in ucs16 which is a fixed width 2 byte char set
2015-01-15 20:47 <hef1> the indexes are using too much space, so I deleted them
2015-01-15 20:47 <bry> I know what they are, I just don't understand the nitty gritty
2015-01-15 20:48 <bry> or query plans
2015-01-15 20:48 <bry> I just bet my job with a coworker on whether or not a PK existed on a certain table
2015-01-15 20:49 <bry> the PK column name? user_id
2015-01-15 20:49 <bry> the table? auth.Users
2015-01-15 20:49 <bry> I probably shouldn't do that again
2015-01-15 20:49 <agocs> Users seems like one of those tables where you could have a composite key
2015-01-15 20:50 <agocs> Composite on mothers_maiden_name and zip_code
2015-01-15 20:50 <bry> ha
2015-01-15 20:50 <hef1> The next version of django is getting this: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#uuidfield
2015-01-15 20:51 <t_j> oh how I wish mysql had a UUID type
2015-01-15 20:51 <t_j> native that is
2015-01-15 20:52 <t_j> that you could reliably use as an FK without adding a int ID, oh and supported /auto incriment/ 
2015-01-15 20:52 <NegativeK> Elon Musk is building a test Hyperloop track.
2015-01-15 20:52 <NegativeK> Fucking weird future shit.
2015-01-15 20:53 <hef1> honestly json support in postgres is mind blowing: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/functions-json.html
2015-01-15 20:56 <agocs> Big change set
2015-01-15 20:56 <agocs> Like a week in the making
2015-01-15 20:56 <agocs> 15 files
2015-01-15 20:57 <agocs> Should the commit message be "#YOLO"
2015-01-15 20:57 <agocs> ?
2015-01-15 20:57 <NegativeK> Various Changes and Bugfixes
2015-01-15 20:57 <agocs> "changed some things"
2015-01-15 20:57 <NegativeK> Repeat the short, vague commit message in the commit body.
2015-01-15 20:57 <NegativeK> Ohh, just make the commit message ".".
2015-01-15 20:59 <agocs> ContactMessageSummary is linked to Party via ContactMessageSummaryPartyLink. 
2015-01-15 20:59 <agocs> A SoftDelete on a Party now cascades through the ContactMessageSummaryPartyLink, and Hibernate no longer picks up the softDeleted ContactMessageSummaryPartyLink.
2015-01-15 20:59 <agocs> #yolo
2015-01-15 21:00 <hef1> about a week ago I learned you could have a pk on multiple columns
2015-01-15 21:00 <hef1> which makes sense in retrospec
2015-01-15 21:00 <hef1>  because multi column index exists
2015-01-15 21:00 <hef1> It just didn't occur to me that a pk could do that too
2015-01-15 21:03 <hef1> make your commit message "reverted HEAD^^^^^^"
2015-01-15 21:04 <hef1> but check in an actual hash
2015-01-15 21:06 <loans> hah
2015-01-15 21:08 <sylphiae> agocs: i missed you at lunch
2015-01-15 21:08 <agocs> hef1: This is the big legacy project in SVN anyhow, so I think they'd see through that
2015-01-15 21:08 <agocs> sylphiae: I missed y'all too. 11:30 was when I could get some time from the local ORM master to show me what I was doing.
2015-01-15 21:10 <sylphiae> hmm, about other upscroll, i just cut my hair cuz of tangles but would love to learn how to braid
2015-01-15 21:11 <sylphiae> i recently paid $25 at a drybar for a french braid...>.< 
2015-01-15 21:11 <bry> I'm not very good at them on myself yet
2015-01-15 21:12 <sylphiae> it's probably easier but also less necessary with 4 less inches of hair
2015-01-15 21:12 <sylphiae> my stylist said that i should sleep in braids to avoid tangles? unsure if that makes sense
2015-01-15 21:12 <bry> hu what
2015-01-15 21:13 <bry> that sounds like a lot of work
2015-01-15 21:13 <sylphiae> yeah it does
2015-01-15 21:13 <bry> I just make sure to condition really well
2015-01-15 21:13 <sylphiae> what kind of conditioner do you use? i must have tried 20 different ones in the past few months
2015-01-15 21:13 <bry> I mean, I still get mega tangles sometimes
2015-01-15 21:14 <bry> factors that increase it: not conditioning every day, winter (coats and static), not combing through once a day
2015-01-15 21:14 <bry> but I use herbal essence. I'm pretty cheap
2015-01-15 21:14 <sylphiae> i really like the herbal essence shampoo, but i don't think their conditioner is that great
2015-01-15 21:15 <bry> I just go through so much conditioner
2015-01-15 21:15 <sylphiae> yeah, i'd imagine
2015-01-15 21:15 <sylphiae> i tried expensive conditioner and it wasn't much better though
2015-01-15 21:15 <sylphiae> i liked some of the whole foods ones, but i settled on some cheap suave professionals one
2015-01-15 21:15 <sylphiae> because nothing really stood out
2015-01-15 21:15 <bry> My stylist had me start using um
2015-01-15 21:15 <bry> moroccan oil?
2015-01-15 21:15 <sylphiae> the herbal essences one leaves silicone in my hair
2015-01-15 21:15 <sylphiae> oh yeah, i have that too:) it's great
2015-01-15 21:16 <bry> I had to stop using one brand
2015-01-15 21:16 <bry> because it was making me flaky
2015-01-15 21:16 <bry> It's another cheepy
2015-01-15 21:17 <sylphiae> i tried garnier fructis cuz one of my hs friends swears by it but it just slides over my hair and does nothing
2015-01-15 21:17 <sylphiae> my hair is pretty thick:-/ 
2015-01-15 21:17 <Toba> haha hte hair conversation continues
2015-01-15 21:17 <bry> Mine is super, super thin
2015-01-15 21:17 <sylphiae> but i will practice braiding your hair:) 
2015-01-15 21:17 <bry> yay
2015-01-15 21:17 <bry> I think garnier is the stuff I had to quit using
2015-01-15 21:18 <Toba> hold on
2015-01-15 21:18 <sylphiae> yeah i thought so
2015-01-15 21:18 <Toba> why hasn't ps1 figured out how to make shampoo and conditioner yet
2015-01-15 21:18 <sylphiae> good question!
2015-01-15 21:18 <Toba> I made soap last year
2015-01-15 21:18 <Toba> it wasn't that hard
2015-01-15 21:18 <sylphiae> hey last night at trivia one of the questions was: what does tyler durden make in his factory in fight club
2015-01-15 21:18 <bry> ha
2015-01-15 21:18 <Toba> explosives, duh
2015-01-15 21:18 <Toba> (but mostly soap)
2015-01-15 21:18 <loans> ugh
2015-01-15 21:18 <`justin> sylphiae: trick question, he didn't have a factory
2015-01-15 21:18 <`justin> he had a house
2015-01-15 21:18 <sylphiae> Toba: i mentioned that i'm using this beer shampoo before
2015-01-15 21:18 <Toba> !
2015-01-15 21:18 <sylphiae> we can make beer and shampoo
2015-01-15 21:19 <loans> you know those LED fixtures i brought to the space, the ones that break pretty catastrophically
2015-01-15 21:19 <sylphiae> it's really shitty though
2015-01-15 21:19 <bry> There is caffeinated shampoo out there somewhere
2015-01-15 21:19 <`justin> also, he wasn't a real person
2015-01-15 21:19 <sylphiae> but! beer + shampoo
2015-01-15 21:19 <loans> i specifically recommended we only ship them in the manufacturer case inserts, because that supports them on more than just the fragile plastic headcover
2015-01-15 21:19 <sylphiae> `justin: stop spoiling the movie:P 
2015-01-15 21:19 <loans> i just saw four of them dropped in milk crates with random foam
2015-01-15 21:19 <loans> so all their weight is on, you guessed it, the fragile headcover
2015-01-15 21:19 <loans> jessus christ 
2015-01-15 21:20 <bry> your place is not professional at all
2015-01-15 21:20 <`justin> sylphiae: what? very few fictional characters are real people
2015-01-15 21:20 <sylphiae> loans: i look forward to your complaints about the new place
2015-01-15 21:20 <`justin> lol
2015-01-15 21:20 <sylphiae> but trivia was weird last night
2015-01-15 21:20 <sylphiae> the questions were either super easy or really tough
2015-01-15 21:20 <loans> new place mostly seems to be staffed by reasonably competent individuals
2015-01-15 21:21 <`justin> "man, fuck this place. they keep doing everything i say. why would they even listen to me?"
2015-01-15 21:21 <loans> which is why they have like, a hundred times the inventory this company does
2015-01-15 21:21 <loans> with the same number of employees
2015-01-15 21:21 <CarlFK> loans: is new place a sure thing?
2015-01-15 21:21 <loans> and a building that's not literally falling apart
2015-01-15 21:22 <loans> CarlFK: reasonably - don't have written offer yet, but the guy said 'we have a verbal agreement' which is a weird thing to say if you're planning on reneging on an offer
2015-01-15 21:22 <bry> that's exciting!
2015-01-15 21:24 <CarlFK> loans: kick ass!  that is certainly encouraging 
2015-01-15 21:25 <Toba> :D
2015-01-15 21:25 <Toba> no more ncc for loans soon!
2015-01-15 21:25 <loans> srs
2015-01-15 21:27 <NegativeK> If the new place is full of awesome competent people to learn from..
2015-01-15 21:27 <NegativeK> ..does that make loans the new ncc?
2015-01-15 21:27 <Toba> :D
2015-01-15 21:27 <loans> bry: http://i.imgur.com/fAL9iqr.jpg
2015-01-15 21:28 <bry> haha
2015-01-15 21:28 <`justin> there's a difference between ncc and lcc
2015-01-15 21:28 <NegativeK> Loans CC.
2015-01-15 21:28 <NegativeK> lbcc
2015-01-15 21:28 <`justin> less
2015-01-15 21:28 <Toba> loans cc compiles code
2015-01-15 21:28 <NegativeK> Laden CC.
2015-01-15 21:30 <`justin> Toba: so does ncc
2015-01-15 21:30 <NegativeK> LederCC.
2015-01-15 21:30 <`justin> just not very well
2015-01-15 21:32 <NegativeK> Hahaha, a friend's company has a dog on their "Team" page as the Director of Fun.
2015-01-15 21:32 <NegativeK> I want a Director of Fun.
2015-01-15 21:32 <`justin> the director of fun directs everyone to lick their own balls today
2015-01-15 21:32 <Toba> uh
2015-01-15 21:32 <`justin> then eat your own poop
2015-01-15 21:33 <sylphiae> ^NegativeK

2015-01-15 22:11 <Rei> I don't drink. I'm the person who painted the octopus in the stairway. 
2015-01-15 22:11 <agocs> I heard about the octopus yesterday
2015-01-15 22:11 <loans> agocs: yeah but not all of them weigh a hundred pounds
2015-01-15 22:11 <NegativeK> Today's octopus is yesterday's one-eyed squid.
2015-01-15 22:12 <agocs> tomorrow's space-octopus, with cybernetic tentacles and jetpack.
2015-01-15 22:12 <`justin> my handle is my name
2015-01-15 22:12 <Toba> in irc, justin has a name

2015-01-15 22:13 <NegativeK> Tomorrow's space-octopus is known as an octomorph.

2015-01-15 22:19 <NegativeK> So, a coworker has blue cone monochromacy -- which means he is effectively blind to color.
2015-01-15 22:19 <NegativeK> Blue text on a white background is just white nothingness to him.

2015-01-15 22:19 <Toba> he must not like facebook
2015-01-15 22:20 <Rei> That's got to be weird. 
2015-01-15 22:20 <NegativeK> We were discussing new functionality yesterday and the higher ups wanted to differentiate between users with text color and a little thin-line corner.
2015-01-15 22:20 <NegativeK> I'm slightly colorblind, but enough to fail at that (25 colors?!?!?!), so they were fine with adding a "Colorblind mode" to the app. :D

2015-01-15 22:24 <sylphiae> that is true
2015-01-15 22:24 <Rei> Blue, green and cyan all look like completely different colours to me.  Which can cause weirdness because I divide colours into too many piles.

2015-01-16 02:28 <DoormanDave> I fear I might need threading for this dockerbot feature
2015-01-16 02:28 <NegativeK> I am now more terrified.
2015-01-16 02:29 <DoormanDave> just cause sometimes it takes a while to pull in docker images and forgets to respond to irc pings =/
2015-01-16 02:29 <NegativeK> Ahh.
2015-01-16 02:29 <loans> DoormanDave: better do it in go

2015-01-16 02:29 <DoormanDave> I bet the docker library for go is pretty awesome
2015-01-16 02:29 <DoormanDave> seeing as docker is written mostly in go
2015-01-16 02:30 <NegativeK> PS:1 should write a language called stop.
2015-01-16 02:30 <NegativeK> The hello world will instead be a hammer time program.

2015-01-16 02:52 <loans> zirc is an actuator though
2015-01-16 02:52 <NegativeK> Yeah..
2015-01-16 02:52 <loans> is it good practice to have things be actuators AND sensors?
2015-01-16 02:52 <NegativeK> It'd be best if it was push based.
2015-01-16 02:52 <loans> (we get to define that)
2015-01-16 02:53 <NegativeK> They could be different, but why not?

2015-01-16 17:03 <NegativeK> Hah!
2015-01-16 17:03 <bry> I don't think I'd be able to switch colors at this job
2015-01-16 17:03 <bry> although, they did say there wasn't a dress code....
2015-01-16 17:03 <Toba> hair color?
2015-01-16 17:03 <bry> yeah
2015-01-16 17:03 <Toba> oh
2015-01-16 17:04 <Toba> does anyone else in the office have different colored hair?
2015-01-16 17:04 <bry> you didn't realize that I had to only wear purple shirts here at northwestern?
2015-01-16 17:04 <Toba> ..no
2015-01-16 17:04 <bry> that's good cuz it's not ture
2015-01-16 17:04 <bry> anyways, no everyone here is normal
2015-01-16 17:04 <bry> and have normal hobbies and crap
2015-01-16 17:04 <bry> and like children
2015-01-16 17:04 <NegativeK> DoormanDave: I've seen you not constantly interrupt people, so your switch is at least more functional.
2015-01-16 17:04 <bry> *and, like, children
2015-01-16 17:05 <bry> No one has weird anything
2015-01-16 17:05 <bry> I'm the only one in the office who wears jeans
2015-01-16 17:05 <DoormanDave> bry: does that make me normal?
2015-01-16 17:05 <bry> definitely not
2015-01-16 17:06 <bry> But it just feels like people here have the following hobbies: family, sports, and drinking
2015-01-16 17:06 <bry> and I'm the super odd one out
2015-01-16 17:06 <DoormanDave> I've got two of those hobbies.
2015-01-16 17:06 <DoormanDave> in addition to others.
2015-01-16 17:07 <DoormanDave> yeah, I miss that about my old job, no one there was like a standard boring person really
2015-01-16 17:08 <DoormanDave> they were all pretty interesting and awesome personally, I just couldn't stand to work with many of them
2015-01-16 17:08 -!- iiie0___(~iiie1@73.8.80.190) has joined #pumpingstationone
2015-01-16 17:09 <bry> That's the one and only thing I miss about my last job. There are definitely cliques here.
2015-01-16 17:09 <DoormanDave> bry: if you want to work with a bunch of nerdy weirdos, do night webhosting support =P
2015-01-16 17:09 <misterbonnie> it's usually better to have fortified personal boundaries at work
2015-01-16 17:10 <DoormanDave> yeah, agreed, I'm pretty good about separating a working and personal relationship but in the past it's been difficult, especially when I was friends with a lot of the admins I was managing.
2015-01-16 17:11 <DoormanDave> I was put into some difficult spots, for sure.
2015-01-16 17:13 <loans> i dont know shit about most of my coworkers
2015-01-16 17:13 <loans> and i ak generally okay with that
2015-01-16 17:14 <DoormanDave> yeah, I had grown up with a few of said admins
2015-01-16 17:15 <DoormanDave> and it was shitty to see one get let go for literally doing jack shit on his 12 hr shifts despite telling him for months to do his damn job or they were gonna fire him.
2015-01-16 17:15 <DoormanDave> I dunno, it was like he thought since we were buds he didn't have to do shit.
2015-01-16 17:16 <loans> i dont think i could manage to do no work at all
2015-01-16 17:16 <DoormanDave> I know right!
2015-01-16 17:16 <loans> like, i slack a lot, but i still get shit donr
2015-01-16 17:16 <loans> done

2015-01-16 17:51 <Toba> you keep weirdly detailed track of your breakfast
2015-01-16 17:51 <agocs> Or did you arrange all that on a plate?
2015-01-16 17:51 <DoormanDave> agocs: I've always wanted to give it a go actually.
2015-01-16 17:51 <Toba> plating is important agocs.
2015-01-16 17:51 <sylphiae> normally i don't, but it was strange today

2015-01-16 17:56 <agocs> To be fair, I had to nag some people to get them to reply to you, because Person A thought Person B was supposed to do it and vice versa
2015-01-16 17:56 <Toba> oh
2015-01-16 17:56 <Toba> maybe they replied, just too late
2015-01-16 17:57 <agocs> Toba: was that also the email where your name didn't get filled in properly?

2015-01-16 17:59 <sylphiae> also between the two of us i have a job

2015-01-16 18:19 <DoormanDave> it went into the secondary what, tuesday?
2015-01-16 18:19 <loans> i think arch, so i can send people away with "homework"
2015-01-16 18:20 <DoormanDave> cool
2015-01-16 18:20 <DoormanDave> I have a really old bottle of cider I made

2015-01-16 18:21 <Toba> yup
2015-01-16 18:21 <DoormanDave> or is the yeast done?
2015-01-16 18:22 <Toba> but i want to transfer it to a secondary
2015-01-16 18:22 <Toba> not becaues anyone told me to
2015-01-16 18:22 <Toba> but because it feels Right
2015-01-16 18:22 <Toba> to do so
2015-01-16 18:22 <DoormanDave> Toba: you don't want to taste some 3yr old cider?

2015-01-16 18:29 <DoormanDave> loans: afa icons and login manager, I'd just tell them my lazy way of doing it =P

2015-01-16 18:31 <`justin> Toba: sylphiae moved her beer to secondary fermentation on tuesday
2015-01-16 18:31 <`justin> so i doubt if it's ready to keg
2015-01-16 18:31 <`justin> ryan helped her
2015-01-16 18:31 <`justin> and i'm a bit irritated at him
2015-01-16 18:31 <`justin> because i made sylphiae get another 6 gallon carboy, then ryan convinced her to use one of the 5 gallons instead
2015-01-16 18:32 <`justin> which seemed utterly pointless
2015-01-16 18:32 <`justin> but
2015-01-16 18:32 <`justin> whatever

2015-01-16 18:40 <DoormanDave> yeah that's a good idea =P

2015-01-16 18:52 <sylphiae> and oh yes, i did get a 6 gallon carboy
2015-01-16 18:52 <Toba> k
2015-01-16 18:52 <Toba> not ready to keg then prolly
2015-01-16 18:52 <sylphiae> that we then didn't use...
2015-01-16 18:52 <sylphiae> we took a specific gravity reading too
2015-01-16 18:52 <sylphiae> i'll add it to the wiki 
2015-01-16 18:52 <Toba> cool
2015-01-16 18:52 <Toba> what was it?
2015-01-16 18:52 <Toba> <= 1.03?

2015-01-16 18:53 <Toba> (1.03 was acquired through a pulled out of ass method)
2015-01-16 18:54 <sylphiae> 1.036
2015-01-16 18:54 <sylphiae> so good job pulling that # out of your ass
2015-01-16 18:54 <Toba> It's probably not quite done then
2015-01-16 18:54 <Toba> but is mostly there
2015-01-16 18:54 <Toba> about right for going into secondary

2015-01-16 19:06 <Toba> python's logger module infuriates me.
2015-01-16 19:06 <Toba> its default behaviour is to be a pile of shit.

2015-01-16 19:12 <Toba> what if I have a printed canvas and need to stretch it on a frame
2015-01-16 19:12 <Toba> and fucking up the canvas is bad because the print is expensive
2015-01-16 19:13 <Toba> what do you advise?
2015-01-16 19:13 <loans> practicing a couple times, probably
2015-01-16 19:14 <loans> a pre-printed thing sucks a little
2015-01-16 19:14 <loans> normally you size it with a mix of glue and water that pulls it tight
2015-01-16 19:14 <loans> once it is stretched
2015-01-16 19:14 <loans> or paint will do thay, too
2015-01-16 19:15 <Toba> but that's harder when it's printed
2015-01-16 19:15 <Toba> because you can't easily do that
2015-01-16 19:15 <loans> yeah
2015-01-16 19:15 <Toba> you can spray something on the back of the the print i think?

2015-01-16 19:19 <Toba> might be able to
2015-01-16 19:19 <Toba> but there is probably a reason that's not regularly done
2015-01-16 19:19 <loans> sure
2015-01-16 19:19 <Toba> maybe just wood cost

2015-01-16 20:24 <loans> i'll give you three guesses
2015-01-16 20:25 <`justin> "Dear Valued Employer, I humbly submit my resignation, along with a request to have Microsoft Excel be installed on my company issued computer. Yours Truly, loans. <3"
2015-01-16 20:25 <loans> oh, MS office
2015-01-16 20:25 <loans> i just didn't parse it right
2015-01-16 20:25 <`justin> language, yadda yadda
2015-01-16 20:27 <`justin> make sure to use a <3 in your resignation
2015-01-16 20:27 <`justin> so that crappy manager knows you send the resignation with love
2015-01-16 20:27 <loans> oh i'mnot submitting it to crappy manager
2015-01-16 20:27 <loans> fuck him
2015-01-16 20:27 <`justin> or at least less than 3 of something
2015-01-16 20:27 <greetermon> need to make sure all the info got copied
2015-01-16 20:27 <loans> i basically hvae just stopped reporting to him whenever possible
2015-01-16 20:28 <loans> which, as he doesn't bother to manage me
2015-01-16 20:28 <loans> is most of the time
2015-01-16 20:28 <Toba> did you steal all the info you intend on robbing your job of loans
2015-01-16 20:28 <Toba> yet
2015-01-16 20:28 <Toba> greetermon is trying to help you
2015-01-16 20:29 <loans> there's no useful infor here
2015-01-16 20:29 <Toba> ha
2015-01-16 20:30 <`justin> customer lists with contact info
2015-01-16 20:30 <`justin> manufacturer manuals that are hard to acquire
2015-01-16 20:30 <loans> i dont sales, the latter isnt really a thing
2015-01-16 20:30 <`justin> a backup of all your work emails, in case someone tries to sue you
2015-01-16 20:31 <`justin> well, all communications that you can back up, anyways
2015-01-16 20:31 <loans> how do you even back up exchange emails
2015-01-16 20:31 <`justin> there's a button somewhere in outlook
2015-01-16 20:32 <`justin> google will be your friend there
2015-01-16 20:32 <`justin> your shitbox might crash while trying to do it though
2015-01-16 20:32 <loans> yeah but do you need outlook to unbackup

2015-01-16 20:33 <`justin> they might be some weird MS format, but probably still has the text inside
2015-01-16 20:34 <loans> ivan has to be incredibly fastidious about backing up his emails
2015-01-16 20:34 <loans> because dlab computers keep destroying his outlook archive
2015-01-16 20:35 <loans> (like, 5 years of email)
2015-01-16 20:35 <loans> and crappy manager won't do anything about it
2015-01-16 20:35 <`justin> oh, well then he probably knows how to do it
2015-01-16 20:35 <`justin> ask him
2015-01-16 20:37 <`justin> my version of outlook allows me to export my emails to a CSV
2015-01-16 20:38 <`justin> it's... probably not the version you have...

2015-01-16 20:38 <`justin> someone make a bot that can say sudlowbot like that for me
2015-01-16 20:39 <`justin> it takes too long to type to really feel like an exclamation.
2015-01-16 20:39 <NegativeK> I think that I'm going to crap out a robot during SIBOT.
2015-01-16 20:39 <loans> thbpp
2015-01-16 20:39 <`justin> also, make it text tac when i do that

2015-01-16 20:40 <`justin> lol
2015-01-16 20:40 <NegativeK> You sent it out and I was like "I'm judgin'!"
2015-01-16 20:40 <`justin> i tried to give you shit about it last night
2015-01-16 20:40 <NegativeK> And then sylphiae stole by judge spot and I forgot about registering.
2015-01-16 20:40 <`justin> when i answered your question 3 hours later
2015-01-16 20:40 <`justin> but you ignored me :'-(
2015-01-16 20:40 <NegativeK> I had a question?
2015-01-16 20:40 <NegativeK> Oh, I was PyPNin'.
2015-01-16 20:40 <`justin> yeah, you asked how many people registered already
2015-01-16 20:41 <NegativeK> Oh!
2015-01-16 20:41 <NegativeK> ...how many?
2015-01-16 20:41 <`justin> 14, not including Toba/sylphiae because judging
2015-01-16 20:41 <NegativeK> Damn; that's a lot.
2015-01-16 20:41 <`justin> also not including bioguy because absenteeism
2015-01-16 20:41 <`justin> also not including you
2015-01-16 20:41 <`justin> because you didn't register
2015-01-16 20:42 <Toba> 14!
2015-01-16 20:42 <Toba> wow
2015-01-16 20:42 <NegativeK> Right?
2015-01-16 20:42 <NegativeK> Even if half show up, I'll be impressed.
2015-01-16 20:43 <`justin> yeah
2015-01-16 20:43 <`justin> i don't even know who half these people are
2015-01-16 20:43 <NegativeK> Crappy robot name invented on the spot: Unilowbrow.
2015-01-16 20:43 <`justin> at least half
2015-01-16 20:43 <greetermon> need to make sure all the info got copied
2015-01-16 20:43 <NegativeK> Was there a ruling on "can my robot be plugged in?"
2015-01-16 20:44 <NegativeK> It'll likely make the robot crappier than using magnets.
2015-01-16 20:44 <sylphiae> agocs: you guys don't have a kitchen?? *shakes head*

2015-01-16 20:44 <NegativeK> `justin: 15.
2015-01-16 20:44 <`justin> i don't remember
2015-01-16 20:45 <`justin> Toba, sylphiae: what do you think about plugged in robots?
2015-01-16 20:45 <`justin> pretty crappy, i guess
2015-01-16 20:45 <Toba> I think they are pretty crappy.
2015-01-16 20:45 <NegativeK> In all likelihood, it's going to get tangled in its own cord.
2015-01-16 20:45 <sylphiae> NegativeK: i did not -steal- your judge spot
2015-01-16 20:45 <`justin> sweet
2015-01-16 20:45 <NegativeK> Like, I don't think that'll be avoidable. And I don't want to try to avoid it.
2015-01-16 20:45 <NegativeK> sylphiae: STOLED
2015-01-16 20:46 <NegativeK> Swooped in and ganked.
2015-01-16 20:46 <`justin> i think i'll allow plugged in
2015-01-16 20:46 <`justin> but you must provide your own extension cord!
2015-01-16 20:46 <NegativeK> I might just rip some power strips off of the electronics tables.
2015-01-16 20:46 <misterbonnie> !tgif
2015-01-16 20:46 <sylphiae> i agree that they're fine
2015-01-16 20:46 <NegativeK> Daisy chain five of them, even if one is needed.
2015-01-16 20:46 <`justin> NegativeK: yeah, good enough
2015-01-16 20:47 <`justin> suuuudlooooowbooooot!!!!!!!
2015-01-16 20:47 <NegativeK> Maybe make a converter so one female plugs is connected to two male plugs so the only guarantee about the power strips is "acyclic".
2015-01-16 20:47 <`justin> what?
2015-01-16 20:47 <Toba> it's ok for it to be cyclic
2015-01-16 20:48 <Toba> due to the fact that each power strip has only one plug
2015-01-16 20:48 <Toba> if they're cyclic you can't plug the whole thing into the wall
2015-01-16 20:48 <`justin> i totally read that last word as "acrylic"
2015-01-16 20:48 <Toba> ha
2015-01-16 20:48 <Toba> do u even graph theory bruh???
2015-01-16 20:48 <NegativeK> I can if I get that one female plug, two male plug Y thing from hell.
2015-01-16 20:48 <Toba> uh
2015-01-16 20:48 <Toba> that's a horrible idea

2015-01-16 20:52 <NegativeK> Maybe I could grab that terrifying acrylic bender heater where the two prongs could seperate.
2015-01-16 20:53 <NegativeK> So neutral could be dangling on the table when you had the hot plug in the socket.

2015-01-16 21:19 <loans> nothing egregious
2015-01-16 21:19 <`justin> just silly things
2015-01-16 21:19 <`justin> one person from epilog says "lol yeah, you can laser that"

2015-01-16 21:20 <Toba> i see the thread now
2015-01-16 21:21 <loans> wikipedia confirms that theyre made of PVC in the first paragraph
2015-01-16 21:21 <skay> what line should I add to pg_hba.conf to allow connections to my db, assuming my db is in an lxc image and I want to connect to it from the host machine?
2015-01-16 21:21 <skay> I figured I'd ask that here, since it seems I'm not going to get an answer from the postgresql channel today
2015-01-16 21:21 <skay> it might be too weird
2015-01-16 21:21 <loans> dont_suck = 1
2015-01-16 21:22 <Toba> just ask it
2015-01-16 21:22 <Toba> if it doesnt get an answer
2015-01-16 21:22 <skay> Toba: I did ask
2015-01-16 21:22 <Toba> what does that hurt
2015-01-16 21:22 <Toba> oh
2015-01-16 21:22 <Toba> dur
2015-01-16 21:22 <Toba> sorry
2015-01-16 21:22 <skay> Toba: someone told me I'd have to edit the hba stuff. and mentally I'm going, no duh. why do you think I came in here to ask how to configure postgres
2015-01-16 21:22 <skay> though to be fair, I didn't specificallys ay pg_hba.conf
2015-01-16 21:22 <skay> hence specifying the fuck out of it now
2015-01-16 21:24 <skay> they have been pretty helpful before, but the lxc angle might not be a good one
2015-01-16 21:24 <skay> maybe I can go read the postgresql juju charm code to see how they deploy and expose postgres
2015-01-16 21:25 <skay> would you like to be a duck?

2015-01-16 21:28 <loans> i mean, thats true of acrylic, too
2015-01-16 21:29 <`justin> irritating fumes doesn't necessarily mean damage to the laser cutter...
2015-01-16 21:29 <loans> which, as the guy said, we have extraction
2015-01-16 21:29 <`justin> corrosive fumes though...
2015-01-16 21:29 <loans> i think it could br tested safely enough, but i would not be surprised if it cut poorly

2015-01-16 23:05 <`justin> time to go home

2015-01-16 23:05 <sylphiae> hmm
2015-01-16 23:05 <loans> i think gobot has drivers that can drop in
2015-01-16 23:05 <sylphiae> well, the march on washington was actually more focused for economic rights
2015-01-16 23:05 <hef> that would help
2015-01-16 23:05 <sylphiae> you could see that as for more vacation days & sick days, etc
2015-01-16 23:06 <hef> I kind of want to make a "fake" SerialREader that reads from stdin

2015-01-16 23:07 <hef> looking at the github page
2015-01-16 23:07 <loans> i can't figure out if you can use that to fake a microcontroller or not
2015-01-16 23:07 <loans> but gobot has a driver for it i think, which might be something to explore
2015-01-16 23:07 <greetermon> drivers that can say sudlowbot like that for me that has a departure monologue? 
2015-01-16 23:08 <hef> I was going to be far lazier in my faking
2015-01-16 23:08 <loans> or it may require that an arduino is plugged in
2015-01-16 23:08 <loans> i dunno
2015-01-16 23:08 <hef> It looks designed to make an arduino do things from the pc
2015-01-16 23:09 <hef> I was going to create a RFIDReader Class
2015-01-16 23:09 <hef> that took a "/dev/ttyS0" type parameter in it's constructor
2015-01-16 23:09 <hef> so that the tty device is configurable
2015-01-16 23:10 <loans> i'm just thinking about the GPIO stuff
2015-01-16 23:10 <hef> and have that handle tty parsing (begine message/end message/ bullshit)
2015-01-16 23:10 <hef> ah
2015-01-16 23:10 <hef> I was going to do something similar
2015-01-16 23:10 <loans> that's the hard part i think
2015-01-16 23:10 <hef> StatusIndicator Class
2015-01-16 23:10 <hef> have a BBB version
2015-01-16 23:10 <hef> a RPI version
2015-01-16 23:10 <hef> and a PC version that just outputs to stdout
2015-01-16 23:11 <loans> we might need to whiteboard that forr me to get why it isn't a pain in the ass
2015-01-16 23:11 <hef> I havn't looked at gobot yet
2015-01-16 23:11 <hef> so it still might be
2015-01-16 23:11 <loans> maybe we can whiteboard it to show that it is a pain in the ass, i dunno
2015-01-16 23:12 <hef> hah
2015-01-16 23:12 <loans> i think there could be some optimiztion in the way i'mdoing gobot stuff
2015-01-16 23:12 <loans> so that maybe there can be a ps1rfid.conf that sets parameters like platform, which pins you're using
2015-01-16 23:12 <hef> yeah
2015-01-16 23:12 <loans> i don't know anything about generalizing software so this is a big guessing game for me
2015-01-16 23:13 <hef> OOP bullshit
2015-01-16 23:13 <loans> yeah
2015-01-16 23:13 <hef> you define the functions a class would have
2015-01-16 23:13 <hef> and then you define several different implementations
2015-01-16 23:13 <loans> i think i can imagine a struct for the platform and what happens when you scan a tag
2015-01-16 23:13 <hef> so the things that call the class don't care what they are actually calling, they just care that they call the function the exact same way
2015-01-16 23:13 <loans> so maybe it won't be that much of a stretch

2015-01-17 00:07 <Toba> haha
2015-01-17 00:08 <loans> a few weeks for shit from china usually doesn't bother me
2015-01-17 00:08 <loans> 'cause it's so cheap
2015-01-17 00:09 <Toba> yea
2015-01-17 00:09 <Toba> it isn't bothering me really
2015-01-17 00:09 <Toba> just in an impatient way
2015-01-17 00:09 <loans> yeah
2015-01-17 00:09 <loans> that's fair
2015-01-17 00:09 <loans> i usually forget about it
2015-01-17 00:09 <Toba> I just want to start my project
2015-01-17 00:09 <Toba> usually I do too
2015-01-17 00:09 <loans> and then when it shows up it's a pleasant surprise
2015-01-17 00:09 <Toba> I should have ordered this when I first wanted it
2015-01-17 00:09 <Toba> not when I wanted to start the project
2015-01-17 00:09 <Toba> oh well
2015-01-17 00:09 <loans> what is it you're waiting on?
2015-01-17 00:10 <Toba> dht22 temp/humidity sensor & ESP8266 wifi+microcontroller board
2015-01-17 00:10 <Toba> there are 2 other things I ordered also but they aren't key
2015-01-17 00:10 <loans> ah
2015-01-17 00:11 <loans> it's weird that you can't get cheap beaglebones from china
2015-01-17 00:11 <loans> not that i've seen
2015-01-17 00:11 <loans> anyway
2015-01-17 00:11 <bjonnh> Toba: loans: customs don't take stuff?
2015-01-17 00:11 <Toba> they sometimes do.
2015-01-17 00:12 <loans> bjonnh: i have never had that happen
2015-01-17 00:12 <Toba> it hasn't happened to me, I've only orderd a handful of things.

2015-01-17 00:14 <loans> i wonder what they want  for 10 of 'em
2015-01-17 00:14 <Toba> ah one of those bid to buy things?
2015-01-17 00:15 <Toba>  US $0.01 - 100 / Piece 
2015-01-17 00:15 <Toba> lol
2015-01-17 00:15 <loans> alibaba connects you directly with manufacturers
2015-01-17 00:15 <loans> so you end up hashing out a deal with them
2015-01-17 00:15 <loans> and/or getting scammed
2015-01-17 00:16 <Toba> haha
2015-01-17 00:16 <Toba> totally ripping the element14 name too
2015-01-17 00:16 <Toba> counterfeit goods are fun for everyone!
2015-01-17 00:16 <loans> well i mean

2015-01-17 01:37 <Toba> nice
2015-01-17 01:37 <Toba> gigawatts121: long time no see, where you keepin yourself?
2015-01-17 01:38 <gigawatts121> hehe, plenty of projects keeping me busy at home
2015-01-17 01:38 <Toba> ha, k
2015-01-17 01:38 <Toba> home-building, home-making, home-fixing, or home-automating
2015-01-17 01:39 <gigawatts121> pretty much all of the above, yes
2015-01-17 01:39 <Toba> nice.
2015-01-17 01:40 <gigawatts121> btw, I've used your metra webtool, I like it
2015-01-17 01:41 <Toba> oh, thanks!
2015-01-17 01:41 <Toba> any suggestions?
2015-01-17 01:41 <Toba> I use it most days
2015-01-17 01:41 <Toba> I was thinking of adding weather indications for both ends of the trip
2015-01-17 01:42 <gigawatts121> I've seen the "receiving gps data" msg before, does their API actually include coordinates?
2015-01-17 01:42 <Toba> no
2015-01-17 01:42 <gigawatts121> :(
2015-01-17 01:42 <Toba> it is an indication from their side, that the prediction is based on GPS info
2015-01-17 01:42 <Toba> it's more of an indication that the prediction probably isn't bs
2015-01-17 01:42 <gigawatts121> yeah, kind of figured
2015-01-17 01:42 <Toba> sadly, they don't provide it
2015-01-17 01:42 <Toba> that would be great
2015-01-17 01:42 <Toba> they don't really have an API, even
2015-01-17 01:42 <gigawatts121> a live map would have been sweet
2015-01-17 01:43 <Toba> I had to cobble this together from all sorts of shitty shit.
2015-01-17 01:43 <Toba> well
2015-01-17 01:43 <Toba> if someone can give me a database of metrastation shortnames (the ones they have in the 'api') & the gps coords i could do that.
2015-01-17 01:43 <Toba> because I already wrote that for cta once.
2015-01-17 01:43 <Toba> and I'm pretty close to abstracting the metra trainlines into the same API as I did for the cta ones
2015-01-17 01:44 <Toba> the idea being
2015-01-17 01:44 -!- hef-(~androirc@c-24-1-28-100.hsd1.il.comcast.net) has joined #pumpingstationone
2015-01-17 01:44 <Toba> that you can use the differential arrival times for various stations
2015-01-17 01:44 <Toba> to determine where the train must be between station a and b
2015-01-17 01:44 <gigawatts121> ooh, nice
2015-01-17 01:44 <Toba> the runs have numbers
2015-01-17 01:44 <Toba> so if you look at predictions from A -> C
2015-01-17 01:44 <Toba> and B -> C
2015-01-17 01:44 <Toba> you see the different predicted departure time
2015-01-17 01:45 <Toba> and can use that to determine transit time between A and B
2015-01-17 01:45 <Toba> then you can use it for plots of another train, that happens to between the 2 right now
2015-01-17 01:45 <Toba> and tada
2015-01-17 01:45 <Toba> you can interpolate the position
2015-01-17 01:45 <Toba> of course, my code was wrong in that it assumed the track is a straight line between the statoins
2015-01-17 01:45 <Toba> but who really cares :)
2015-01-17 01:45 <gigawatts121> I live near track, that I have to cross to get out of my neighbor hood, It would certainly to be interesting to have a "train near" alert type of thing
2015-01-17 01:46 <Toba> haha
2015-01-17 01:46 <gigawatts121> on the NCS line
2015-01-17 01:46 <Toba> that would not be something to want to rely on
2015-01-17 01:46 <Toba> haha
2015-01-17 01:46 <Toba> given how shitty their ajax endpoints are that i got this from
2015-01-17 01:46 <Toba> and sometimes they are just wrong 
2015-01-17 01:46 <gigawatts121> yeah, I know, more of a fun thing to see
2015-01-17 01:46 <Toba> it doesn't happen often, but it does happen
2015-01-17 01:46 <Toba> haha yeah
2015-01-17 01:46 <gigawatts121> and that wouldnt account for the freight lines on the same track, either
2015-01-17 01:47 <Toba> one of the things I want is alerts on my watch/phone to indicate that my train is late or on time
2015-01-17 01:47 <Toba> without having to go to the considerable trouble of loading up a webpage 
2015-01-17 01:47 <Toba> (lol)
2015-01-17 01:47 <gigawatts121> ah, that would be neat
2015-01-17 01:47 <gigawatts121> just got a pebble myself, so I'm exploring what all it can do

2015-01-17 19:56 <hef_> but I am not currently doing that step
2015-01-17 19:56 <loans> so we're probably best not to rely on zirc for records keeping
2015-01-17 19:56 <loans> got it
2015-01-17 19:56 <hef_> so for right now, anyone could post ipn looking data and zirc would respond
2015-01-17 19:56 <hef_> right
2015-01-17 19:56 <hef_> eventually, I want the ipn sensor to be reliable
2015-01-17 19:57 <hef_> so that people can do whatever creative thing they want

2015-01-17 22:39 <Toba> hef_: I'm thinking of doing UDP + msgpack (which can be hard coded pretty easily) with a bridge
2015-01-17 22:39 <Toba> hef_: input is welcome, but not required
2015-01-17 22:40 <Toba> hef_: also have you given any thought to long term static IP allocations that will not be expected to change for the forseeable future inside our RFC1918 space?

2015-01-17 22:45 <tac> IP addresses are just numbers mannnnn
2015-01-17 22:45 <Toba> it's true
2015-01-17 22:45 <loans> everyone's got a gui
2015-01-17 22:45 <Toba> but I either have to hard code some IPs into some microcontroller ROM
2015-01-17 22:45 <Toba> or
2015-01-17 22:45 <asl2> except for me and my monkey
2015-01-17 22:46 <Toba> I have to implement DNS usage on microcontrollers
2015-01-17 22:46 <Toba> which might be something I ought to do
2015-01-17 22:46 <Toba> but I'm looking for an excuse not to
2015-01-17 22:46 <asl2> Toba: to be fair, you just need a stub resolver
2015-01-17 22:46 <Toba> I know
2015-01-17 22:46 <Toba> it's not that hard
2015-01-17 22:47 <Toba> the protocol is pretty damn simple
2015-01-17 22:47 <Toba> I'm just lazy
2015-01-17 22:50 <asl2> I think those of us not programming microcontrollers at all deserve more to be called lazy
2015-01-17 22:50 <greetermon> i have a feeling I may appreciate this down the road =P

2015-01-17 22:53 <hef_> Toba: so far my plan is to not use arduino's or teensies
2015-01-17 22:53 <Toba> k
2015-01-17 22:53 <hef_> because an embeddes system + ethernet capability is usually fairly expensive
2015-01-17 22:54 <Toba> right
2015-01-17 22:54 <hef_> so to me it makes more sense to attache the physical sensors to an existin BBB or rpi
2015-01-17 22:54 <Toba> well, if you have ideas about the proto that pop up feel free to share
2015-01-17 22:54 <hef_> I want to add guid's to messages
2015-01-17 22:54 <Toba> hm, why
2015-01-17 22:54 <Toba> guid of what
2015-01-17 22:54 <Toba> users?
2015-01-17 22:54 <Toba> assign guids to sensors?
2015-01-17 22:54 <hef_> event guids
2015-01-17 22:55 <Toba> hm
2015-01-17 22:55 <Toba> I'm curious why that provides anything
2015-01-17 22:55 <hef_> In general -- a message may be seen more than once
2015-01-17 22:55 <Toba> oh, sort of a sequence id
2015-01-17 22:55 <Toba> but without making it sequential
2015-01-17 22:55 <Toba> to de-dupe events?
2015-01-17 22:55 <hef_> yeah
2015-01-17 22:56 <Toba> I see the point there
2015-01-17 22:56 <Toba> I can make the broker add them if they aren't already there
2015-01-17 22:56 <Toba> pretty easily
2015-01-17 22:56 <Toba> and add support for that to the thingsbus zmq adaptor
2015-01-17 22:56 <hef_> and if a message get's transformed and re-emitted, it can reference the original guid
2015-01-17 22:56 <Toba> hm
2015-01-17 22:56 <Toba> what case do you expect to see transform + re-emit
2015-01-17 22:56 <hef_> so far, -paypal ipn data
2015-01-17 22:57 <Toba> do paypal IPNs have guids?
2015-01-17 22:57 <Toba> er, events
2015-01-17 22:57 <hef_> they have transaction ids
2015-01-17 22:57 <hef_> also, I want a way to attache the rfid/door open/door close events together
2015-01-17 22:57 <Toba> h
2015-01-17 22:57 <Toba> m
2015-01-17 22:58 <Toba> if you think about it
2015-01-17 22:58 <Toba> a transaction is just a grouping of smaller quanta of event-ness
2015-01-17 22:58 <Toba> so calling them transaction ids isnt a bad idea anyway
2015-01-17 22:58 <hef_> -- it would also be useful for reannouncing state
2015-01-17 22:58 <Toba> well
2015-01-17 22:58 <Toba> this brings up another thing
2015-01-17 22:58 <Toba> right now
2015-01-17 22:58 <hef_> if you announce new messages with a guid and the guid doesn't change
2015-01-17 22:58 <Toba> on thingsbus
2015-01-17 22:58 <Toba> no event documents itself
2015-01-17 22:59 <Toba> it's juts got the namespace
2015-01-17 22:59 <greetermon> thingsbus... SSH has to offer than
2015-01-17 22:59 <Toba> haha
2015-01-17 22:59 <Toba> yes, greetermon 
2015-01-17 22:59 <Toba> anyway
2015-01-17 22:59 <Toba> I was thinking of adding a documentation url field
2015-01-17 22:59 <Toba> generally it'd point to a markdown doc on github, or a ps1 wiki page
2015-01-17 22:59 <Toba> making it required for data to have it
2015-01-17 22:59 <Toba> to enter thingsbus
2015-01-17 23:00 <hef_> that makes sense
2015-01-17 23:00 <Toba> oh another thing
2015-01-17 23:00 <Toba> i wanted to make a webpage 
2015-01-17 23:00 <hef_> I havn't documented any protocols yet because everythign is still very prototypy
2015-01-17 23:00 <Toba> that'd be the 'ui' of thingsbus
2015-01-17 23:00 <Toba> very much like what you talked about
2015-01-17 23:00 <Toba> the othre week
2015-01-17 23:00 <Toba> and make it so it would automatically show a link to the docs
2015-01-17 23:00 <Toba> if htere was one
2015-01-17 23:00 <Toba> and show current data, how old it is
2015-01-17 23:00 <Toba> and make that page, have a qr code on it
2015-01-17 23:00 <Toba> so we can, on the various things that provide data
2015-01-17 23:00 <Toba> put a qr url sticker
2015-01-17 23:00 <Toba> click it
2015-01-17 23:01 <Toba> and it does 4 things
2015-01-17 23:01 <Toba> 1) explain how to get the code to read the data
2015-01-17 23:01 <Toba> 2) show the current data
2015-01-17 23:01 <Toba> 3) show docs of what the data means
2015-01-17 23:01 <Toba> 4) I coulda sworn there was a 4th thing.
2015-01-17 23:01 <Toba> it'd be totally pickable-up from just reading the messages off thingsbus
2015-01-17 23:01 <hef_> makes sense 
2015-01-17 23:02 <Toba> I thought about making the broker do 1 thing that actually persists
2015-01-17 23:02 <Toba> writing the most recently sent doc url to a kv store
2015-01-17 23:02 <Toba> so that even if it's 'down'
2015-01-17 23:02 <Toba> the docs are still findable
2015-01-17 23:02 <Toba> the url on the qr codes would be like
2015-01-17 23:02 <hef_> we should make a page of "common fields"
2015-01-17 23:02 <Toba> oh to try to standardize the formats?
2015-01-17 23:02 <hef_> it would make sense to have the same "key" for docs
2015-01-17 23:03 <hef_> and the same key for unique id
2015-01-17 23:03 <Toba> I saw your https://wiki.pumpingstationone.org/Things_Bus#A_Simple_Example section, it's not actually using thingsbus :(
2015-01-17 23:03 <Toba> oh
2015-01-17 23:03 <Toba> here's the thing
2015-01-17 23:03 <Toba> the way the messages go out
2015-01-17 23:03 <Toba> the data and the namespace are separated
2015-01-17 23:04 <hef_> that sounds right
2015-01-17 23:04 <Toba> I wouldn't want the unique id to be in the data
2015-01-17 23:04 <Toba> they would be at the same top level
2015-01-17 23:04 <Toba> they would be required fields
2015-01-17 23:04 <Toba> hence, not in the 'do whatever you want' data area
2015-01-17 23:04 <hef_> the namespace I have in there is a zmq filtering mechanizm
2015-01-17 23:04 <hef_> it would make sense to put namespace type things in the data as well
2015-01-17 23:05 <Toba> hold up
2015-01-17 23:05 <Toba> i see what you're doing
2015-01-17 23:05 <Toba> door.state.unlock is the topic
2015-01-17 23:05 <Toba> right?
2015-01-17 23:05 <hef_> yeah
2015-01-17 23:05 <Toba> hrm
2015-01-17 23:05 <Toba> I feel like we're sorta solving different problems
2015-01-17 23:06 <Toba> and are diverging a bit
2015-01-17 23:06 <hef_> definately
2015-01-17 23:06 <Toba> as long as it all crosses over, I don't see the issue with it though
2015-01-17 23:06 <Toba> I need to make zmqfan support multipart msgs
2015-01-17 23:06 <hef_> I was thinking I was going to need to add code to your broker to grab all of the existing/known sensors and XPUB the data
2015-01-17 23:06 <Toba> that'd be very nice
2015-01-17 23:06 <hef_> for PUB
2015-01-17 23:07 <Toba> that's what i'm doing with the generic adaptor
2015-01-17 23:07 <hef_> cool
2015-01-17 23:07 <Toba> it can munge random zmq shit

2015-01-17 23:07 <Toba> ooooh, nice one.
2015-01-17 23:08 <Toba> it's taking the zmq api i already built into lidless
2015-01-17 23:08 <hef_> It makes the broker not strictly required, but really useful
2015-01-17 23:08 <Toba> and using it to get the info
2015-01-17 23:08 <Toba> well, yes
2015-01-17 23:08 <hef_> also woot on getting new members
2015-01-17 23:08 <Toba> the way I see it, individual things may well continue to talk directly to each other
2015-01-17 23:08 <Toba> as a way to integrate quickly
2015-01-17 23:08 <hef_> and that the ipn neuron I wrote is actually working
2015-01-17 23:08 <Toba> :D
2015-01-17 23:08 <Toba> is that going into thingsbus too or just zirc
2015-01-17 23:08 <hef_> just zirc
2015-01-17 23:09 <Toba> hrm
2015-01-17 23:09 <hef_> the neuron is talking to the ipn signal and zirc as an actuator
2015-01-17 23:09 <Toba> the way I wrote it, the thingsbus client has a thread in it
2015-01-17 23:09 <hef_> Where is the thingsbus broker running?
2015-01-17 23:09 <Toba> bellamy
2015-01-17 23:09 <Toba> but you don't need to know that
2015-01-17 23:09 <Toba> because the lcient and adaptor will find it using srv record :)
2015-01-17 23:09 <Toba> just do
2015-01-17 23:10 <Toba> thingsbus.adaptor.Adaptor('your.thing.name', zone='pumpingstationone.org')
2015-01-17 23:10 <Toba> and then do .send on that to send data and it's done
2015-01-17 23:10 <Toba> it's a daemon thread, so you don't have to hsut it down on exit
2015-01-17 23:10 <Toba> it'll die by itself

2015-01-17 23:10 <Toba> I have errands to run and it's 5 already
2015-01-17 23:11 <Toba> I feel like we should have a thingsbus event/working group

2015-01-17 23:11 <Toba> that i have to leave or the thread :p
2015-01-17 23:11 <hef_> that you have to run errands
2015-01-17 23:12 <hef_> I figured we were goingto have a thingsbus workgring group thing one of these saturdays
2015-01-17 23:12 <Toba> yea we should

2015-01-18 00:17 <loans> tachoknight, sylphiae: no worries
2015-01-18 00:17 <loans> we had a couple folks
2015-01-18 00:18 <loans> everyone walked away with a working install of Arch
2015-01-18 00:18 <loans> so I'm calling it a success
2015-01-18 00:18 <loans> i know now that a general purpose 'usin the command line' class would definitely be a seperate thing
2015-01-18 00:19 <tachoknight> that could easily be a 2 hour class
2015-01-18 00:19 <loans> oh man i forgot to tell 'em to install ntp
2015-01-18 00:19 <tachoknight> would be awesome
2015-01-18 00:19 <loans> they'll figure it out
2015-01-18 00:19 <hef_> neat
2015-01-18 00:19 <hef_> what hardware were people using?
2015-01-18 00:19 <loans> hef_: one guy had an oldish laptop, another guy did a VM on his new mac
2015-01-18 00:20 <loans> tachoknight: the 'let's install arch' format is informative, i think, and definitely has value
2015-01-18 00:20 <loans> i think it would be pretty doable to work out a 'curriculum' for a 'let's do shit with the command line' class
2015-01-18 00:21 <tachoknight> i agree with both
2015-01-18 00:21 <loans> i was able to evangelize fish
2015-01-18 00:21 <loans> which i'm happy about
2015-01-18 00:22 <tachoknight> definitely a great way to get people cozy with linux
2015-01-18 00:22 <tachoknight> just installed latest fedora in a vm, trying to figure out this systemd thing
2015-01-18 00:22 <loans> systemd is pretty nice
2015-01-18 00:23 <tachoknight> i've read it has a lot of nice features, but it completely replaces init which freaks some folks out
2015-01-18 00:23 <loans> if, like me, you have never ever written an init script, it's great
2015-01-18 00:24 <tachoknight> i have, actually, quite a few
2015-01-18 00:24 <tachoknight> mostly booting oracle and tomcat in solaris
2015-01-18 00:24 <hef_> i think that writing init scripts sucks
2015-01-18 00:24 <tachoknight> s/booting/starting
2015-01-18 00:24 <hef_> each distro has specific conventions
2015-01-18 00:24 <hef_> and for the most part, no one follows the convetions
2015-01-18 00:24 <tachoknight> i would also agree with that
2015-01-18 00:25 <hef_> I found writing unit files to be much easuer
2015-01-18 00:25 <hef_> easier
2015-01-18 00:25 <loans> in systemd you write a unit file and it just seems to work 
2015-01-18 00:25 <hef_> also, socket activation is sweet for services that support it
2015-01-18 00:25 <loans> i haven't noticed any differences between debian on the beaglebone or debian on a VPS or arch on a real computer
2015-01-18 00:26 <hef_> I'm looking at arch on the rpi agian
2015-01-18 00:26 <loans> that's probably what i would pick
2015-01-18 00:27 <hef_> last time I tried linux on a pi, the 256MB of ram was a source of headache
2015-01-18 00:27 <hef_> the new one has 512
2015-01-18 00:27 <hef_> hopefully that will be better
2015-01-18 00:28 <loans> woof, 256 would be tough
2015-01-18 00:28 <loans> my 'main' vps doesn't have much
2015-01-18 00:28 <loans> 256
2015-01-18 00:28 <hef_> that's the $1 a month one?
2015-01-18 00:28 <loans> yeah
2015-01-18 00:29 <hef_> you are effectively renting a pi
2015-01-18 00:29 <loans> it's got 4 cores though
2015-01-18 00:29 <hef_> and an old pi at that
2015-01-18 00:29 <hef_> oh nice
2015-01-18 00:29 <loans> so it's definitely not as cpu-bound
2015-01-18 00:29 <loans> oh, i actually upgraded because it wouldn't run wordpress
2015-01-18 00:29 <loans> i've got the next level up
2015-01-18 00:29 <loans> the $1/mo one only has 128mb
2015-01-18 00:29 <loans> i think i pay $3/mo now
2015-01-18 00:30 <loans> the $1/mo is single-core
2015-01-18 00:30 <hef_> I still want to setup jenkins, and have some embedded systems as build slaves
2015-01-18 00:30 <hef_> because it's funny
2015-01-18 00:31 <loans> that'd be cool
2015-01-18 00:39 <loans> my desktop needs a modern graphics card
2015-01-18 00:39 <loans> according to some random benchmarking site, my laptop card is just about as performant

2015-01-18 00:48 <hef_> I used to have jenkins tests for ps1auth
2015-01-18 00:48 <DoormanDave> some of those odroids would probably be okay for building =P
2015-01-18 00:48 <hef_> I'm pretty sure I broke them all
2015-01-18 00:48 <DoormanDave> lol
2015-01-18 00:49 <hef_> actually, I did
2015-01-18 00:49 <hef_> because I upgraded django enough times that I broke backwards compatability with the unit tests
2015-01-18 00:53 <tachoknight> loans: where are you getting $3/mo vps?
2015-01-18 00:53 <loans> tachoknight: chicagovps.net
2015-01-18 00:53 <loans> it's not great
2015-01-18 00:53 <tachoknight> aws is crazy expensive
2015-01-18 00:53 <loans> for $2 more you get 512mb at digitalocean
2015-01-18 00:54 <loans> which is who i recommend
2015-01-18 00:54 <loans> i can get you a code for $10 credit if you want
2015-01-18 00:54 <tachoknight> looking for a place to store private git repo

2015-01-18 00:55 <tachoknight> thanks loans!
2015-01-18 00:55 <tachoknight> gonna give it a try
2015-01-18 00:56 <tachoknight> i've been using aws for everything, but my boss is starting to ask about the $$$ i'm spending
2015-01-18 00:56 <tachoknight> and the best thing i've learned so far is i don't want to use aws for my own personal stuff
2015-01-18 00:58 <loans> hah
2015-01-18 01:02 <Toba> man
2015-01-18 01:02 <Toba> my at&t is fuuuucked.
2015-01-18 01:05 <loans> Toba: how so?
2015-01-18 01:10 <hef_> neovim apparantly works as a backend to atom
2015-01-18 01:10 <hef_> which bodes well for me, in that it might work in the future as a backend to MSVS
2015-01-18 01:10 <hef_> and I can get real vim support
2015-01-18 01:10 <hef_> including plugins
2015-01-18 01:12 <hef_> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH_zb7X6mZw
2015-01-18 01:12 <tachoknight> hef_: i assume you've tried vsvim?
2015-01-18 01:13 <hef_> indeed
2015-01-18 01:13 <Toba> oh, just lagging to hell & back.
2015-01-18 01:13 <hef_> it emulates vanilla vim
2015-01-18 01:13 <tachoknight> all the syntax, but none of the plugins
2015-01-18 01:13 <hef_> right
2015-01-18 01:14 <tachoknight> i've waffled back and forth about wanting a more custom vim experience ... i get used to using plugins, then log into a machine without them and get all confoozled

2015-01-18 01:17 <loans> i'm really hesitant to install a bunch of plugins or remap a bunch of stuff in vim
2015-01-18 01:18 <loans> the remapping, especially. I'd hate to get used to something one one of my 'real' computers and then get mad every time I instantiate a vps or something

2015-01-18 01:30 <hef_> I was trying to search for something I knew existed
2015-01-18 01:31 <loans> is that why you were talking about systemd timers earlier
2015-01-18 01:32 <loans> i'm interested in those btw
2015-01-18 01:32 <hef_> that's why it was on my mind, yeah
2015-01-18 01:32 <hef_> rt.ad.pumpingstationone.org has a ton of them in /etc/systemd/system
2015-01-18 01:32 <hef_> basically, create a service file like normal (for a process that exits)
2015-01-18 01:33 <hef_> create a paired .timer file (with the same name as the service file)
2015-01-18 01:33 <hef_> and start/enable the .timer file

2015-01-19 16:22 <loans> im not doing that
2015-01-19 16:22 <NegativeK> Cram coleslaw down your pants, sling it at the door as you're walking out of the building.
2015-01-19 16:22 <DoormanDave> coleslaw is THE way to signify that your work at an employer is complete.
2015-01-19 16:22 <NegativeK> "This is my coleslaw notice." *Splat.*
2015-01-19 16:22 <DoormanDave> it's like saying "Over" on RF, they'll assume you are still working until the coleslaw comes out.
2015-01-19 16:23 <NegativeK> ^

2015-01-19 18:01 <DoormanDave> "After one drink of BulletproofÂ® Coffee, youâ€™ll never be tempted to eat fat-free, insulin-raising, fat-storing toast and oatmeal breakfasts again!"
2015-01-19 18:01 <loans> oh, this triac is toast
2015-01-19 18:02 <`justin> loans: you can have it for breakfast
2015-01-19 18:02 <NegativeK> Kinda want to upgrade to the Nexus 6.
2015-01-19 18:02 <NegativeK> But I really don't want a phone that's described as a phablet ("phaplet".)
2015-01-19 18:03 <asl2> NegativeK: buy it as a small tablet?
2015-01-19 18:03 <DoormanDave> so call it a thone.
2015-01-19 18:03 <NegativeK> Ohhhh, a thone.
2015-01-19 18:03 <NegativeK> I could blame my speech therapist for not getting rid of my thisp completely.
2015-01-19 18:03 <loans> the heater was stuck on
2015-01-19 18:03 <DoormanDave> me had to see a speech therapist in grade school
2015-01-19 18:04 <DoormanDave> did jack shit, evidently.
2015-01-19 18:04 <loans> triac pretending to be a wire
2015-01-19 18:04 <NegativeK> Mine got rid of my actual lisp.
2015-01-19 18:04 <NegativeK> And praised me for knowing words like mortgage and budget, which I learned from playing OG Sim City.
2015-01-19 18:04 <DoormanDave> hah
2015-01-19 18:04 <sylphiae> hah
2015-01-19 18:04 <DoormanDave> and reticulating splines?
2015-01-19 18:04 <NegativeK> Nah.
2015-01-19 18:04 <sylphiae> i saw one briefly in 4th grade, since i couldn't pronounce the "th" sound 
2015-01-19 18:04 <`justin> speech therapist: that's not a word...
2015-01-19 18:05 <sylphiae> i said it like a d or an f...cuz there is no th sound in dutch? 
2015-01-19 18:05 <NegativeK> I did learn how to swallow water with my mouth open, though.
2015-01-19 18:05 <DoormanDave> yeah, my aunt had a bunch of german exchange students stay with her when I was younger
2015-01-19 18:05 <NegativeK> Squirrel.
2015-01-19 18:05 <DoormanDave> we tried to make them say thursday
2015-01-19 18:05 <`justin> NegativeK: i'll bet that sounds pleasant
2015-01-19 18:05 <loans> citric acid definitely smells how it tastes
2015-01-19 18:06 <NegativeK> `justin: YouTube has shit tons of people cruelly getting German people to try to say squirrel.
2015-01-19 18:06 <DoormanDave> NegativeK: that is also a useful skill for many other things.
2015-01-19 18:06 <sylphiae> :-/ i have forgotten all of my dutch, unfortunately
2015-01-19 18:07 <`justin> i meant the swallowing of water with your mouth open
2015-01-19 18:07 <`justin> probably sounds incredibly pleasant
2015-01-19 18:07 <DoormanDave> me too =P
2015-01-19 18:07 <NegativeK> Oh.
2015-01-19 18:07 <NegativeK> I can't imagine it having much of a sound.
2015-01-19 18:07 <NegativeK> It's just a rolling tongue motion.
2015-01-19 18:07 <`justin> i can imagine it sounding a bit like choking
2015-01-19 18:07 <DoormanDave> ACTION can swallow all sorts of objects with his mouth open.
2015-01-19 18:08 <`justin> DoormanDave: yes... we know...
2015-01-19 18:08 <NegativeK> ...swords?
2015-01-19 18:08 <DoormanDave> nope never got into the sword swallowing
2015-01-19 18:08 <NegativeK> `justin: Sounds the same to my ears.
2015-01-19 18:08 <sylphiae> ACTION does not want to know
2015-01-19 18:08 <DoormanDave> but I can eat/spit fire
2015-01-19 18:08 <DoormanDave> and juggle it
2015-01-19 18:08 <NegativeK> DoormanDave: How dangerous is spitting fire?
2015-01-19 18:09 <DoormanDave> NegativeK: pretty dangerous, you need to have good stream control to avoid blowback.
2015-01-19 18:09 <DoormanDave> and good breath control, for obvious reasons.
2015-01-19 18:09 <NegativeK> Like.. How safe can it be made, if the impressive results aren't the priority?
2015-01-19 18:09 <NegativeK> Hm.
2015-01-19 18:09 <NegativeK> I know paying attention to wind is really important. =(
2015-01-19 18:09 <DoormanDave> practice spitting water in a fine stream
2015-01-19 18:09 <bjonnh> well petrol based flammable liquid are not safe at all
2015-01-19 18:09 <bjonnh> especially for long term
2015-01-19 18:09 <DoormanDave> yeah
2015-01-19 18:09 <NegativeK> bjonnh: Slomo Guys did it with corn starch to a much lesser effect. >.>
2015-01-19 18:09 <bjonnh> but they work well
2015-01-19 18:10 <DoormanDave> then theres the long term affects of putting fuels in your mouth
2015-01-19 18:10 <`justin> bjonnh: plenty of flammable liquids are safe to put in your mouth
2015-01-19 18:10 <bjonnh> yeah corn stach, powdered chocolate
2015-01-19 18:10 <`justin> powdered chocolate is flammable?
2015-01-19 18:10 <DoormanDave> don't use any citronella fuels =P
2015-01-19 18:10 <bjonnh> `justin: yep
2015-01-19 18:10 <DoormanDave> ACTION knows that from experience
2015-01-19 18:10 <DoormanDave> the citronella taste does not go away
2015-01-19 18:10 <bjonnh> DoormanDave: you don't have mosquitoes problems since !
2015-01-19 18:11 <`justin> some say DoormanDave can still taste citronella to this day
2015-01-19 18:11 <DoormanDave> ACTION drank a shot of white gas once
2015-01-19 18:11 <DoormanDave> I was told it was moonshine
2015-01-19 18:11 <DoormanDave> so I braced myself
2015-01-19 18:11 <`justin> wow, that's just cruel
2015-01-19 18:11 <DoormanDave> and they were shocked I A: drank it
2015-01-19 18:11 <DoormanDave> and B: Kept it down
2015-01-19 18:12 <bjonnh> white gas?
2015-01-19 18:12 <DoormanDave> 3 day hangover
2015-01-19 18:12 <`justin> being shocked at A seems strange
2015-01-19 18:12 <DoormanDave> yeah, I mean, who turns down a shot of moonshine!?
2015-01-19 18:12 <DoormanDave> and spits it out when it tastes like moonshine?
2015-01-19 18:12 <bjonnh> you have strange friends
2015-01-19 18:12 <`justin> i mean
2015-01-19 18:13 <`justin> unless you had good reason not to trust the person who told you that
2015-01-19 18:13 <`justin> which at this point seems kind of reasonable
2015-01-19 18:13 <DoormanDave> I didn't even know this person.
2015-01-19 18:13 <DoormanDave> it was a fellow burning man employee.
2015-01-19 18:13 <DoormanDave> I shouldv'e known better
2015-01-19 18:13 <bjonnh> â€¦
2015-01-19 18:13 <DoormanDave> but it's not uncommon to offer strangers moonshine in that crowd =P
2015-01-19 18:14 <DoormanDave> okay
2015-01-19 18:14 <DoormanDave> laundry and tax filings.
2015-01-19 18:14 <bjonnh> is that already tax time?
2015-01-19 18:14 <`justin> bjonnh: sure
2015-01-19 18:14 <DoormanDave> it is if your company isn't a bunch of slackers 
2015-01-19 18:14 <`justin> if you're already got your w2
2015-01-19 18:14 <`justin> i think mine is already available online
2015-01-19 18:14 <bjonnh> yeah a
2015-01-19 18:14 <bjonnh> I got that
2015-01-19 18:15 <`justin> i suppose i should also do my taxes <.<
2015-01-19 18:15 <bjonnh> when are they due?
2015-01-19 18:15 <`justin> april 15
2015-01-19 18:15 <DoormanDave> bj	april 15th
2015-01-19 18:15 <bjonnh> yeah will try to do that earlier this year
2015-01-19 18:15 <bjonnh> state still owes me money
2015-01-19 18:16 <NegativeK> DoormanDave: Are alcohol based fire breathing fuels a nono?
2015-01-19 18:17 <`justin> NegativeK: you might get drunk just from putting absinthe in your mouth
2015-01-19 18:17 <`justin> even if you don't swallow any
2015-01-19 18:17 <NegativeK> I was thinking vodka or moonshine. >.>
2015-01-19 18:17 <DoormanDave> NegativeK: typically, it also burns hotter and less explosively, so the effect is not as impressive.
2015-01-19 18:17 <`justin> vodka isn't flammable enough
2015-01-19 18:17 <NegativeK> Ah.
2015-01-19 18:18 <DoormanDave> yeah you also need something 100+ proof
2015-01-19 18:18 <`justin> and moonshine might be higher proof than absinthe
2015-01-19 18:18 <NegativeK> Vodka definitely ignites.
2015-01-19 18:18 <`justin> depending on how good the maker of it was
2015-01-19 18:18 <DoormanDave> which is expensive.
2015-01-19 18:18 <loans> straight up grain alcohol
2015-01-19 18:18 <NegativeK> And burns spectacularly in a microwave.
2015-01-19 18:18 <NegativeK> But, no clue about firebreathing.
2015-01-19 18:18 <bjonnh> ^
2015-01-19 18:18 -!- bry(~Adium@c-24-1-28-100.hsd1.il.comcast.net) has joined #pumpingstationone
2015-01-19 18:18 <NegativeK> (Seriously -- if you haven't put a shot glass of burning vodka in the microwave, it's really awesome to see.)
2015-01-19 18:19 <`justin> according to wikipedia, vodka is generally 80 proof
2015-01-19 18:19 <`justin> 40% alcohol
2015-01-19 18:19 <NegativeK> I've lit something that was 60 proof to test someone's claim about the lower-limits of igniteability.
2015-01-19 18:19 <DoormanDave> `justin: actually, poorly made moonshine is probably more flammible
2015-01-19 18:19 <DoormanDave> due to the unhealthy types of ethanol that make it in as a byproduct of imprecise distillery
2015-01-19 18:19 <`justin> DoormanDave: ha, good point
2015-01-19 18:20 <DoormanDave> also the same types of ethanol that make you go blined =P
2015-01-19 18:20 <bjonnh> methanol
2015-01-19 18:20 <DoormanDave> ^
2015-01-19 18:20 <NegativeK> Cure to methanol: drink pure ethanol.
2015-01-19 18:20 <bjonnh> and ethanol is one of the remedies for methanol poisoning
2015-01-19 18:20 <bjonnh> yep
2015-01-19 18:21 <bjonnh> NegativeK: yeah you can ignite many stuff if you warm them up before
2015-01-19 18:21 <DoormanDave> http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/19/world/taiwan-gamer-death/index.html
2015-01-19 18:21 <DoormanDave> wonder what he was playing.
2015-01-19 18:21 <NegativeK> bjonnh: If it's burning when you put it in the microwave, the microwave dumps energy into the plasma/flame.
2015-01-19 18:21 <bjonnh> haha
2015-01-19 18:21 <bjonnh> like the toothpicks
2015-01-19 18:21 <NegativeK> And you get a big ass fireball that's stopped when you hit the "off" button.
2015-01-19 18:22 <DoormanDave> NegativeK: you can generate plasma in a microwave with pretty much anything on fire
2015-01-19 18:22 <DoormanDave> lit cigarettes
2015-01-19 18:22 <NegativeK> ^
2015-01-19 18:22 <DoormanDave> we should do a "Microwave day"
2015-01-19 18:22 <DoormanDave> in the alley
2015-01-19 18:22 <DoormanDave> =P
2015-01-19 18:22 <DoormanDave> with a looooong extension cord
2015-01-19 18:23 <DoormanDave> I want to blow the door off with a hardboiled egg
2015-01-19 18:23 <NegativeK> :o
2015-01-19 18:23 <bjonnh> OHÂ YEAH
2015-01-19 18:23 <NegativeK> I'm going to lunch, but I want to see this scrollback.
2015-01-19 18:23 <DoormanDave> lol
2015-01-19 18:23 <bjonnh> closing irc because procrastination
2015-01-19 18:24 <DoormanDave> same
2015-01-19 18:24 <bjonnh> and microwave stories will get me heated up
2015-01-19 18:24 <DoormanDave> lol
2015-01-19 18:24 <`justin> NegativeK: anyways, you can light lower proof alcohols, but you need to warm them up first
2015-01-19 18:24 <`justin> so i imagine that would be bad for fire spitting
2015-01-19 18:25 <DoormanDave> argh ray
2015-01-19 18:25 <`justin> DoormanDave: get used to saying that ;-P
2015-01-19 18:25 <DoormanDave> don't inform/recap the methods of getting on the roof to the membership at large
2015-01-19 18:26 <DoormanDave> `justin: or compress them,. like diesel
2015-01-19 18:26 <zirc> Door Unlocked
2015-01-19 18:26 <`justin> yes well, higher pressure, i guess
2015-01-19 18:26 <`justin> i learned me some fisics at some point

2015-01-19 18:45 <DoormanDave> heh
2015-01-19 18:46 <`justin> engaging in mortal combat on the roof
2015-01-19 18:46 <`justin> i like it
2015-01-19 18:46 <DoormanDave> certainly Mortal
2015-01-19 18:46 <DoormanDave> =P
2015-01-19 18:46 <`justin> it's more interesting than immortal combat
2015-01-19 18:46 <DoormanDave> I dunno
2015-01-19 18:46 <`justin> immortal combat just goes on and on
2015-01-19 18:46 <DoormanDave> I'm pretty into Highlander
2015-01-19 18:46 <`justin> it never ends
2015-01-19 18:47 <DoormanDave> There can only be one.
2015-01-19 18:47 <hef_> apparantly this is a thing: http://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/2sgzz0/if_jade_is_not_introduced_soon/
2015-01-19 18:47 <`justin> the highlanders were only kind of immortal
2015-01-19 18:47 <loans> hef_: awesome
2015-01-19 18:47 <DoormanDave> I quote Freddy Mercury, from the Highlander theme "Princes of the Universe" - "I am immortal"
2015-01-19 18:47 <DoormanDave> Freddy Mercury, who died.
2015-01-19 18:48 <`justin> see
2015-01-19 18:48 <`justin> kind of
2015-01-19 18:48 <DoormanDave> some forms of "Immortal" mean that you just don't tie from old age.  Like starfish and Vampireds.
2015-01-19 18:48 <`justin> i suppose that's true
2015-01-19 18:49 <DoormanDave> OP better deliver on that thread, Hef
2015-01-19 18:49 <DoormanDave> please tell me that character won't be in that game

2015-01-19 18:49 <`justin> DoormanDave: when i was talking about immortals, i was thinking more like gods
2015-01-19 18:49 <`justin> like

2015-01-19 18:53 <`justin> ah man
2015-01-19 18:53 <`justin> my company has a policy against recieving kickbacks
2015-01-19 18:53 <`justin> ACTION wants some kickbacks :-(
2015-01-19 18:53 <DoormanDave> Sean Connery looks the same now as he did in that pic (1986).  That's what I know about immortals.
2015-01-19 18:57 <DoormanDave> Of course! That explains it.  He drank of the chalice: http://lh6.ggpht.com/-zMdD1bbmY2Q/UfHeViPSMBI/AAAAAAAAVU8/oOGSHAOSaP4/humor05-sean-connery_thumb.jpg
2015-01-19 18:58 <`justin> yeah, but then he crossed the seal...
2015-01-19 18:58 <DoormanDave> if Keith Richards ever dies, I'm going to suspect that Sean Connery killed him for his powers.
2015-01-19 18:59 <`justin> i will remain skeptical of that claim until i see sean connery on stage playing with the rolling stones
2015-01-19 19:01 <DoormanDave> Any PS1ers interested in forming a team for the Chiditarod?
2015-01-19 19:02 <DoormanDave> we could build a sweet cart

2015-01-19 19:04 <DoormanDave> `justin: i was about to mention to you
2015-01-19 19:04 <DoormanDave> that they also need volunteer bike marshalls
2015-01-19 19:04 <DoormanDave> which is also a good time
2015-01-19 19:04 <DoormanDave> and I might do this year
2015-01-19 19:06 <`justin> ooh
2015-01-19 19:06 <`justin> neat
2015-01-19 19:06 <loans> DoormanDave: there's been a couple people involved with it around the space
2015-01-19 19:06 <loans> don't recall who
2015-01-19 19:06 <DoormanDave> probably John Stoner
2015-01-19 19:06 <DoormanDave> and some others
2015-01-19 19:08 <NegativeK> Mac?
2015-01-19 19:09 <NegativeK> Maybe something else. He does stuff like that, though.
2015-01-19 19:09 <NegativeK> WAIT.
2015-01-19 19:09 <NegativeK> Let's build a crappy mouth so I can breath fire from a distance.
2015-01-19 19:09 <NegativeK> Shit flame thrower.
2015-01-19 19:09 <DoormanDave> and put it on a shopping cart for chiditarod?
2015-01-19 19:09 <DoormanDave> their all burning man people, that would go over well.

2015-01-19 19:34 <asl2> but if you're married in a state that respects same-sex marriage but filing in one that doesn't, it might count for fed taxes but not state

2015-01-19 20:01 <NegativeK> Mining will be replaced by "extracting transaction fees", but yeah.

2015-01-19 21:19 <NegativeK> Yeah.
2015-01-19 21:19 <DoormanDave> `justin: usually their season passes are priced such that if you plan on going >2 times in a season it's worth it

2015-01-19 21:21 <`justin> but $6/month if you can get 4 at a time

2015-01-19 21:22 <`justin> and is $71.99

It was a morality core they installed after I flooded the Enrichment Center with a deadly neurotoxin, to make me stop flooding the Enrichment Center with a deadly neurotoxin. So get comfortable while I warm up the neurotoxin emitters.

2015-01-20 03:43 <Toba> what's your dollar value on non-arsepain?
2015-01-20 03:43 <loans> i would assume there's no warranty whatsoever
2015-01-20 03:43 <loans> r4v5: if i wanted to buy 10 beagalebones I would definitely consider it
2015-01-20 03:43 <Toba> the "get fucked, we're all the way in china, what are you going to do, chucklenuts?" warranty
2015-01-20 03:44 <loans> i assume a lot of the bbbs available are like, overrun from producing for element14 or beagleboard
2015-01-20 03:44 <loans> the warranty might be the "Two beaglebones for not much more than the price of one"
2015-01-20 03:46 <Toba> ha
2015-01-20 03:47 <Toba> the "you'll fucking risk it, bub, because hoo boy are these knockoffs cheap" warranty
2015-01-20 03:47 <loans> pretty much
2015-01-20 03:48 <Toba> I'm pretty excited for the 10 wifi-enabled microcontrollers that I bought from china for $47 total last week
2015-01-20 03:49 <Toba> and that's not the cheapest supplier, either
2015-01-20 03:49 <loans> not bad
2015-01-20 03:52 <loans> you got a link to an english datasheet for those
2015-01-20 03:52 <loans> ?

2015-01-20 03:59 <Toba> hm
2015-01-20 03:59 <Toba> I'm not sure that I do
2015-01-20 03:59 <Toba> gimme a sec to find some info
2015-01-20 03:59 <loans> last i heard everything was mostly in chinese still
2015-01-20 03:59 <Toba> https://github.com/gmorell/ws2812esp8266/
2015-01-20 04:00 <Toba> yeah, that's entirely possibly the case
2015-01-20 04:00 <Toba> this is a project my friend is doing
2015-01-20 04:00 <Toba> that is successfully burning the thing
2015-01-20 04:00 <Toba> w/toolchain setup steps
2015-01-20 04:01 <Toba> some other dude started it
2015-01-20 04:01 <bjonnh> hmmm pulseaudio I hate you
2015-01-20 04:02 <Toba> hating pulseaudio is so 5 years ago bjonnh 
2015-01-20 04:02 <Toba> what's it done to ya now
2015-01-20 04:02 <bjonnh> I want a remote computer (on my LAN) to access the soundcard of my laptop
2015-01-20 04:02 <bjonnh> but I get "access denied"
2015-01-20 04:03 <loans> i don't think i even have pulseaudio installed
2015-01-20 04:03 <bjonnh> I activated tcp, removed the auth
2015-01-20 04:03 <bjonnh> â€¦
2015-01-20 04:03 <Toba> maybe it didn't want to be insecure as fuck by default
2015-01-20 04:03 <Toba> lol.
2015-01-20 04:03 <bjonnh> well that's not insecure
2015-01-20 04:03 <bjonnh> LAN is LAN
2015-01-20 04:03 <Toba> ha
2015-01-20 04:03 <loans> that does kinda sound like a thing that could have a couple steps in between
2015-01-20 04:04 <Toba> how the fuck can pulseaudio know if your LAN is secure
2015-01-20 04:04 <Toba> are you suggesting this should work from any comer by default?
2015-01-20 04:04 <loans> magic
2015-01-20 04:04 <Toba> oh
2015-01-20 04:04 <loans> Toba: magic.
2015-01-20 04:04 <Toba> it should use the mindreading module
2015-01-20 04:04 <loans> come on
2015-01-20 04:04 <Toba> sadly, that requires tcp
2015-01-20 04:04 <Toba> it's a bit of a catch-22
2015-01-20 04:05 <bjonnh> well I have pulseaudio on machine A running with "allow incoming tcp with no auth"
2015-01-20 04:05 <loans> "You know what goes really good with fresca? Toba's gintorade" - DoormanDave
2015-01-20 04:05 <bjonnh> and mpd on machine BÂ with "use machine AÂ pulseaudio"
2015-01-20 04:05 <Toba> nice
2015-01-20 04:05 <Toba> i bet it does
2015-01-20 04:10 <bjonnh> well even with auth
2015-01-20 04:10 <bjonnh> same
2015-01-20 04:14 <bjonnh> ahhh
2015-01-20 04:14 <bjonnh> works
2015-01-20 04:14 <bjonnh> paprefs was doing nasty stuff
2015-01-20 04:14 <bjonnh> I configured directly the /etc/pulse/default.pa
2015-01-20 04:14 <bjonnh> so now I can choose from my mpd player if I want to play on headphones on laptop, speakers on the other machine or both
2015-01-20 04:17 <bjonnh> I may be able to do that from work too
2015-01-20 04:18 <bjonnh> takes 2.2Â Mb/s

2015-01-21 17:29 <loans> it would have herculean tasks like "Solve the general issue of dickitude"

2015-01-21 17:29 <Toba> z, we sort of tricked him into the role

2015-01-21 17:30 <Toba> good thing we don't actually need PR right now

2015-01-21 17:30 <sylphiae> remind me how you tricked Z Toba
2015-01-21 17:30 <Toba> not to cast aspersions at whoever is recently elected
2015-01-21 17:30 <Toba> haha
2015-01-21 17:30 <Toba> we nominated him, and didn't tell him until the night of that he was nominated
2015-01-21 17:30 <Toba> and he didn't have time to think about it so accepted it
2015-01-21 17:30 <Toba> haha

2015-01-21 17:31 <skay> How did Z do? I imagine he'd be a great PR director
2015-01-21 17:31 <loans> he probably spoke loudly a lot
2015-01-21 17:31 <hef> can we paint skay as a violent, prone to anger, crusher of souls, sort of board member?
2015-01-21 17:31 <Toba> he did pretty well at first but then got busy with his business and couldn't really do much anymore

2015-01-21 17:32 <loans> skay: hah
2015-01-21 17:32 <Toba> so, you'd be helping skay slay her enemies

2015-01-21 17:33 <hef> Angel was almost off the air before someone properly introduced me to buffy
2015-01-21 17:33 <skay> I stopped watching it because I got tired of watching so much tv

2015-01-21 17:35 <asl2> I dunno - didn't eat meat then either so I would have avoided the blood-consuming crowd
2015-01-21 17:35 <Toba> ha
2015-01-21 17:35 <Toba> blood isn't meat
2015-01-21 17:35 <Toba> or.. is it
2015-01-21 17:35 <sylphiae> meh
2015-01-21 17:35 <sylphiae> i watched a few episodes, pretty mediocre 
2015-01-21 17:35 <sylphiae> i never got what the fans saw in it
2015-01-21 17:36 <asl2> It's actually forbidden more strongly in Judaism - we need to drain the blood and salt and soak meat before it's kosher
2015-01-21 17:36 <skay> I'm glad I stuck through the first season of babylon 5. the first season was often pretty horrible
2015-01-21 17:36 <skay> speaking of shows with inconsistent quality (like Buffy)
2015-01-21 17:37 <skay> ACTION wanders off again
2015-01-21 17:38 <hef> We should dust off Ian's vote
2015-01-21 17:39 <NegativeK> Buffy starts out really rough around the acting edges, but Whedon does good shit.
2015-01-21 17:40 <NegativeK> And it lasted long enough that he could actually build a plot. *Cough-cough-Firefly-Dollhouse.*
2015-01-21 17:40 <bry> so sad about those
2015-01-21 17:41 <NegativeK> Firefly was fun with good actors, but Dollhouse was closer to the sci-fi that I love.
2015-01-21 17:41 <Toba> I did like dollhouse
2015-01-21 17:42 <NegativeK> Coworker asked me to fix the severed cable on a $20 pair of headphones, and I said sure.
2015-01-21 17:42 -!- hef(~hef@host-70-34-134-228.host.ussignalcom.net) has joined #pumpingstationone
2015-01-21 17:42 <NegativeK> He then offered to buy me lunch, which would be $10. And it's one of the simplest soldering jobs possible.
2015-01-21 17:43 <sylphiae> never seen dollhouse, <3 firefly
2015-01-21 17:50 <`justin> also never seen dollhouse
2015-01-21 17:50 <`justin> firefly is great, i liked buffy as well
2015-01-21 17:51 <`justin> though i don't think i ever finished the series
2015-01-21 17:51 <`justin> there's like 9 seasons or something
2015-01-21 17:51 <`justin> longest running joss whedon show ever, probably
2015-01-21 17:51 <hef> 9 seasons is a long running show, regardless
2015-01-21 17:51 <NegativeK> If you do watch Dollhouse, be forewarned that it starts out as trying to make each episode self-contained.
2015-01-21 17:52 <loans> hef: do it
2015-01-21 17:52 <NegativeK> (Buffy was seven seasons. Still a lot.) Kind of like a crime drama. But it gets longer running plots and way more interesting as the show goes on.
2015-01-21 17:52 <`justin> so you're saying i can watch them in any order
2015-01-21 17:52 <hef> loans: I no longer remember what I said I was going to do
2015-01-21 17:52 <NegativeK> `justin: Ahhhhhh no.
2015-01-21 17:52 <`justin> ACTION starts on the last episode of dollhouse
2015-01-21 17:52 <loans> hef: pick something and do it then
2015-01-21 17:52 <NegativeK> Jesus.
2015-01-21 17:53 <hef> there were 2 unaired, or aired out of order episodes from dollhouse
2015-01-21 17:53 <NegativeK> ^
2015-01-21 17:53 <loans> NegativeK: if the headphones aren't failed close enough to the end to just put a new connector on, I would have told him to eat it
2015-01-21 17:53 <loans> headphone cable is bitches
2015-01-21 17:53 <NegativeK> loans: Thin wires?
2015-01-21 17:53 <loans> yeah
2015-01-21 17:53 <NegativeK> Hm.
2015-01-21 17:53 <loans> like, for reals, bitches
2015-01-21 17:54 <NegativeK> I figure he's out nothing if I fail.
2015-01-21 17:54 <NegativeK> So let's soak them in acetone and light that shit on fire.
2015-01-21 17:54 <t_j> fire? where?
2015-01-21 17:54 <Toba> I'm with t_j
2015-01-21 17:54 <NegativeK> AND HE IS SUMMONED
2015-01-21 17:54 <`justin> "yup, i tried to fix them, but for some reason they caught on fire instead"
2015-01-21 17:55 <Toba> "weird"
2015-01-21 17:55 <`justin> "the reason might have been that i soaked them in acetone and lit them on fire"
2015-01-21 17:55 <t_j> NegativeK: 1200 miles of driving took its toll yesterday
2015-01-21 17:55 <NegativeK> t_j: Are you butthurt? XD
2015-01-21 17:55 <NegativeK> "Apparnetly soldering irons light acetone up."

2015-01-21 17:57 <NegativeK> I'm going to link to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_stool_scale whenever I say someone knows their shit.
2015-01-21 17:57 <agocs> t_j: how was the trip?
2015-01-21 17:57 <t_j> agocs: fucking amazing
2015-01-21 17:58 <agocs> I bet
2015-01-21 17:58 <agocs> Pictures?
2015-01-21 17:58 <NegativeK> "Like a sausage or snake but with cracks on the surface."
2015-01-21 17:58 <t_j> oh this snow is deep lets try, truck 1 suck 10' in, truck 2 20' in, 3 30' in 4th and final 40' in 
2015-01-21 17:59 <Toba> whoa, where did you go
2015-01-21 18:00 <t_j> agocs: on the radio from the lead truck, 'careful someon rolled here last year' followed by them drifting through the outside of the corder sideways, I managed to catch a decent drift round the inside at the same tme
2015-01-21 18:00 <t_j> Toba: 600+ mile off road route through the mich UP
2015-01-21 18:00 <Toba> niiiice.
2015-01-21 18:01 <Toba> no use of roads for 600 miles?
2015-01-21 18:01 <Toba> that's pretty impressive
2015-01-21 18:01 <t_j> agocs: recovering the trucks from the deep snow was fun, stepped off the side if the trail at one point at was balls deap in snow
2015-01-21 18:01 <loans> made it to noon. work done - zero
2015-01-21 18:01 <Toba> how the fuck did people do this shit in wagons?
2015-01-21 18:01 <Toba> loans: yay
2015-01-21 18:01 <loans> probably more carefully
2015-01-21 18:01 <NegativeK> Skis on the bottom of the wagons.
2015-01-21 18:01 <t_j> Toba: its not hard, I have a similar route through northen WI
2015-01-21 18:01 <t_j> no at 70mph
2015-01-21 18:02 <Toba> I guess I'm used to the woods of the northeast
2015-01-21 18:02 <agocs> t_j: Do you have a winch?
2015-01-21 18:02 <Toba> where there's 8 foot boulders every 20 feet
2015-01-21 18:02 <`justin> Toba: much slower...
2015-01-21 18:02 <Toba> and frequently the pitch reaches 45 degrees
2015-01-21 18:02 <t_j> agocs: yes it got quite the workout
2015-01-21 18:02 <agocs> I'm sure
2015-01-21 18:02 <agocs> What manufacturer?
2015-01-21 18:02 <t_j> almost killed my battery with it by the 2nd pull
2015-01-21 18:02 <t_j> smittybilt 12k X2O
2015-01-21 18:03 <t_j> with synthetic line
2015-01-21 18:03 <agocs> cool
2015-01-21 18:03 <agocs> I keep debating getting a winch, and along with it a second battery. 
2015-01-21 18:03 <t_j> I could lift a truck into the trees with that thing
2015-01-21 18:04 <Toba> my brother built a crane
2015-01-21 18:04 <Toba> into his jeep
2015-01-21 18:04 <t_j> I had to get my co-pilot to jump in and hold higher rpms to not kill the thing
2015-01-21 18:04 <t_j> agocs: kenetic ropes are the dogs danglies
2015-01-21 18:04 <agocs> I had one with the last jeep
2015-01-21 18:05 <agocs> Wound up snapping it trying to pull a tree off of the trail
2015-01-21 18:05 <Toba> darn
2015-01-21 18:05 <agocs> Toba: I am envious of your brother's truck collection
2015-01-21 18:05 <t_j> i have a 7/8" 25k lb one, it got used a lot
2015-01-21 18:05 <t_j> agocs: we had one snap trying to pull a truck over a snow berm
2015-01-21 18:05 <agocs> Was it pre-damaged?
2015-01-21 18:06 <t_j> nope
2015-01-21 18:06 <agocs> Toba: Actually, I read your brother's thread about his house the other day. I'm a little sad that I'm roughly his age and not doing the same things
2015-01-21 18:06 <t_j> just a hard pull

2015-01-21 19:19 <sylphiae> i'm not going to get any work done
2015-01-21 19:20 <sylphiae> if i keep looking at these graphs and things
2015-01-21 19:20 <`justin> kuroishi: yeah, i mean it was definitely there like 5 years or so ago
2015-01-21 19:20 <`justin> but i haven't tried to go there recently
2015-01-21 19:20 <NegativeK> Hm.
2015-01-21 19:20 <NegativeK> I was 18 when 9/11 happened.
2015-01-21 19:21 <`justin> according to that dialect quiz, i'm most similar to nebraska or kansas...
2015-01-21 19:21 <NegativeK> And I recovered from Neil Boortz and crap.
2015-01-21 19:21 <`justin> least similar to the northeast
2015-01-21 19:22 <kuroishi> I agree =P
2015-01-21 19:22 <sylphiae> `justin: i can see that
2015-01-21 19:22 <sylphiae> apparently i should go to cali
2015-01-21 19:22 <`justin> california dreamin'
2015-01-21 19:22 <sylphiae> i was least similar to philly, MA, and new orleans
2015-01-21 19:22 <sylphiae> i got cali twice in most similar
2015-01-21 19:23 <sylphiae> hmm, i was in 6th grade when 9/11 happened
2015-01-21 19:23 <sylphiae> but bush was president during my formative years
2015-01-21 19:23 <sylphiae> pushing me left
2015-01-21 19:23 <kuroishi> where is "Youseguys"
2015-01-21 19:24 <`justin> kuroishi: probably my uncle
2015-01-21 19:24 <`justin> who grew up on the south side of chicago
2015-01-21 19:24 <`justin> but none of his brothers talk like that, so...
2015-01-21 19:24 <sylphiae> and clinton is probably the first person who was president when i figured out what a president was
2015-01-21 19:24 <`justin> apparently garage sale is most similar to overland park, kansas...
2015-01-21 19:25 <sylphiae> yeah, i put garage sale too
2015-01-21 19:25 <sylphiae> some of the answers are really...unusual
2015-01-21 19:28 <bry> sitting home sick, watching agent carter
2015-01-21 19:30 <kuroishi> wow, I got specifically the south-west suburbs (aurora) where I'm from on that dialect quiz
2015-01-21 19:30 <sylphiae> nice!
2015-01-21 19:31 <kuroishi> least similar to boston =P
2015-01-21 19:31 <sylphiae> my friend got where his mom & dad are from

2015-01-21 19:33 <loans> i took a similar quiz (possibly the same one) and my conscious word choices ruined any chance it had of locating me
2015-01-21 19:34 <`justin> weird how the dialect quiz didn't ask about how to pronounce ethernet... :-P
2015-01-21 19:34 <`justin> NegativeK: ^
2015-01-21 19:34 <loans> they didn't want to include "idiot" in the regions
2015-01-21 19:34 <kuroishi> yeah there is only one way to pronounce that
2015-01-21 19:34 <kuroishi> does NegativeK not know how to say ethernet?
2015-01-21 19:34 <kuroishi> go back to Georgia NegativeK.
2015-01-21 19:35 <`justin> they actually kicked him out of georgia
2015-01-21 19:35 <`justin> because of how he pronounced ethernet
2015-01-21 19:35 <`justin> :-P
2015-01-21 19:35 <kuroishi> HAHAH
2015-01-21 19:36 <t_j> needless to say most of my answers left the whole country dark blue
2015-01-21 19:37 <kuroishi> "Aluminium"
2015-01-21 19:37 <t_j> aluminum is spelt differently (the trade mark)
2015-01-21 19:38 <sylphiae> i think there's different questions on that quiz that show up
2015-01-21 19:38 <sylphiae> i didn't get a question about what easy college classes were called or something, and my friend did
2015-01-21 19:39 <hef> someone told me about a strategy I want to try out

2015-01-21 19:40 <hef> reverse  Bayesian filtering
2015-01-21 19:40 <Toba> haha great
2015-01-21 19:40 <Toba> [21 13:38:23] <@gm>     Commands are executed by cron(8) when the minute, hour, and month of year fields match the current time, and when at least  one of the two day fields (day of month, or day of week) matches the current time (see ``Note'' below).
2015-01-21 19:40 <hef> sylphiae: you're familiar with Bayesian filters?
2015-01-21 19:40 <Toba> [21 13:38:28] <@gm>     Note: The day of a command's execution can be specified by two fields -- day of month, and day of week. If both fields are  restricted (ie, are not *), the command will be run when either field matches the current time. For example, ``30 4 1,15 * 5''  would cause a command to be run at 4:30 am on the 1st and 15th of each month, plus every Friday.
2015-01-21 19:40 <Toba> evidently I implemented cron wrong because someone in the 70s made a really bad decision
2015-01-21 19:41 <Toba> evidently day of month and day of week are OR'd where everything else is ANDed
2015-01-21 19:41 <Toba> in 'correct' cron implementations
2015-01-21 19:41 <kuroishi> Toba: I venture to say that many poor decisions were made in the 70's.
2015-01-21 19:41 <Toba> ha
2015-01-21 19:41 <kuroishi> I wasn't around, but I'm an expert in poor decisions.
2015-01-21 19:41 <t_j> like using m4 for config files
2015-01-21 19:41 <hef> Apparantly you reorder the questions to try and minimize the number of questions required to apply the filter to some high degree

2015-01-21 19:43 <hef> ^
2015-01-21 19:44 <hef> someone taught spamassassin to play chess based on that concept
2015-01-21 19:44 <kuroishi> hah
2015-01-21 19:44 <kuroishi> thats awesome
2015-01-21 19:44 <hef> in spamassassin, it looks at "is the domain key set" "does the domain key match" "does it contain the work  viagra"
2015-01-21 19:44 <hef> and given that A/B are false, and C is true, what is the probablility that this email is spam?
2015-01-21 19:45 <hef> s/work/word/
2015-01-21 19:45 <sylphiae> ah, cool
2015-01-21 19:45 <hef> B is only useful if A is true, in that particular example.  B has very little influence if A is False.
2015-01-21 19:45 <sylphiae> so you want given B and C, what is the probability of A? 
2015-01-21 19:46 <Toba> haha m4.
2015-01-21 19:48 <hef> well, in that example,  the unlisted D is what is the probability that this email is spam?
2015-01-21 19:49 <t_j> Toba: i listed to a talk by Eric Allman at a conference a couple of years ago and he said he would use m4 again if he wrote a new version of sendmail from a blank page
2015-01-21 19:49 <t_j> *listened
2015-01-21 19:49 <hef> well, maybe that's why everyone who uses sendmail hates it
2015-01-21 19:49 <Toba> what
2015-01-21 19:49 <Toba> u wot m8
2015-01-21 19:49 <kuroishi> yep
2015-01-21 19:50 <kuroishi> fuck m4/sendmail confs
2015-01-21 19:50 <hef> someone though m4 was a good idea (fair, it was the only available option) used it, and continues to believe it's still a good idea
2015-01-21 19:50 <Toba> stockholm syndrome
2015-01-21 19:50 <hef> yeah, I could configure sendmail by hand
2015-01-21 19:50 <hef> but not via M4
2015-01-21 19:50 <Toba> I'm sure you all saw the talk about how fucked it is that configure scripts are still built using m4 macros
2015-01-21 19:50 <NegativeK> `justin: Ehhhhhhthernet.
2015-01-21 19:50 <Toba> and autotools still supports versions of unix that haven't been shipped in decades
2015-01-21 19:51 <Toba> purely because nobody knows m4
2015-01-21 19:51 <Toba> and therefore nobody looks 
2015-01-21 19:51 <hef> so I could literally see the option I needed to change, but not in such a way that rerunning the conf generator would not kill it
2015-01-21 19:51 <Toba> at the underpinnings
2015-01-21 19:51 <hef> Toba: I did not

2015-01-21 19:51 <Toba> that would require understanding m4
2015-01-21 19:51 <Toba> and I know I don't want that
2015-01-21 19:51 <t_j> m4 is not that hard
2015-01-21 19:51 <kuroishi> oh man
2015-01-21 19:52 <hef> there are a few options,  waf, scons, cmake, premake
2015-01-21 19:52 <hef> and they all suck in some way
2015-01-21 19:52 <hef> but most of those are better than using autotools
2015-01-21 19:52 <kuroishi> I bet I could do a sendmail bot with maildir and some clever ii fuckery
2015-01-21 19:52 <kuroishi> what an utter waste of time that would be

2015-01-21 21:35 <Toba> If the JINXER did not already call DIBS on the coke, then the coke is owed to the previous DIBSer of the coke.
2015-01-21 21:35 <Toba> SHOTGUN can only be used in exclusion of JINX.
2015-01-21 21:35 <NegativeK> Jinx, you dibsed me a shotgun.

2015-01-21 21:35 <NegativeK> The pants/object of clothing around your ankles is an intentional handicap.
2015-01-21 21:36 <NegativeK> You might have to punch someone and take their pants.
2015-01-21 21:36 <sylphiae> haha
2015-01-21 21:36 <Toba> If you pants someone, this does not automatically invoke the blitz handicap
2015-01-21 21:37 <NegativeK> Unless they call shotgun on beating your face in, in which case you must pants yourself before running away.
2015-01-21 21:37 <Toba> This is based on the concept of Braccae Rea ("guilty pants")

2015-01-21 21:39 <sylphiae> NegativeK: what is your opinion re the wow bao vs cellar's market
2015-01-21 21:39 <Toba> haha
2015-01-21 21:39 <NegativeK> sylphiae: Short hair, don't care.
2015-01-21 21:39 <Toba> last year, we ran the election with votes even for the unopposed
2015-01-21 21:39 <NegativeK> Someone pick.
2015-01-21 21:39 <NegativeK> Toba: That's a good point.
2015-01-21 21:39 <sylphiae> i did pick>.< 
2015-01-21 21:39 <NegativeK> Someone tell me what to tell Nackle.
2015-01-21 21:40 <Toba> Tell nackle "lol whoops, you wanna fight me about it?"
2015-01-21 21:40 <loans> NegativeK: tell him he's a loser
2015-01-21 21:40 <Toba> "let's take this outside"
2015-01-21 21:40 <sylphiae> that we will do wow bao this week and cellar's market next week
2015-01-21 21:40 <sylphiae> and there's something wrong with him
2015-01-21 21:40 <hef> Toba: we actually used your ballet to ensure that the candidates were all valid 
2015-01-21 21:41 <Toba> I am not a ballet dancer, hef.
2015-01-21 21:41 <KyleB> I'm sorry I missed this stirring debate. For future reference, Robert's Rules allow the presiding officer to declare that all unopposed candidates are elected by "acclamation"
2015-01-21 21:41 <hef> KyleB: we explicitly do not use Robert's Rules
2015-01-21 21:41 <Toba> haha hef
2015-01-21 21:41 <NegativeK> Ahhh, but we are MIBS because of something something nobody reads MIBS.
2015-01-21 21:41 <Toba> Oh right
2015-01-21 21:41 <Toba> because I voted remotely
2015-01-21 21:41 <hef> indeed
2015-01-21 21:41 <Toba> and said I voted for all the unooppsed people
2015-01-21 21:41 <Toba> 1 VOTE, IT COUNTS
2015-01-21 21:41 <Toba> did nobody else do that?
2015-01-21 21:41 <hef> 2 votes.  Loans did it after the fact
2015-01-21 21:41 <Toba> hahahahahhahaha
2015-01-21 21:42 <Toba> so by the actual deadline
2015-01-21 21:42 <Toba> I was the only voter
2015-01-21 21:42 <Toba> for most of the fucking candidates?
2015-01-21 21:42 <Toba> and I wasn't even there?

2015-01-21 21:57 <NegativeK> It's because marketing works and they want you to keep using them. =(

2015-01-21 22:13 <hef> in early 2014 I had reached out to SSH:C to see if there was any interested in shareing development/features on ps1auth
2015-01-21 22:13 <hef> I got no reply, so I went on my way
2015-01-21 22:13 <agocs> really
2015-01-21 22:13 <hef> yeah
2015-01-21 22:14 <agocs> what, specifically, is ps1auth
2015-01-21 22:14 <agocs> ldap with features bolted on?
2015-01-21 22:14 <hef> currently, it's our member management system
2015-01-21 22:14 <hef> it manages ldap
2015-01-21 22:14 <`justin> members.pumpingstationone.org
2015-01-21 22:14 <hef> membership
2015-01-21 22:14 <hef> and official emails
2015-01-21 22:15 <`justin> it's where you setup your rfid key to use the magic door thing. :-)
2015-01-21 22:15 <hef> also rfid
2015-01-21 22:15 <hef> we dropped zoho
2015-01-21 22:16 <loans> agocs: i can show you all the ps1auth member management stuff if you want
2015-01-21 22:16 <agocs> Hm
2015-01-21 22:16 <loans> it's seriously superior to zoho in every way
2015-01-21 22:16 <hef> the federation from 2014 was supposed to further complicate our already complicated payment system by having multi hackerspace subscriptions
2015-01-21 22:17 <hef> while simultaneously, we were supposed to dump paypal altogether.  Being the only active coder at the time, I was not a fan.
2015-01-21 22:17 <agocs> Hm
2015-01-21 22:17 <agocs> I vaguely remember this
2015-01-21 22:18 <hef> considering that even still, I havn't switched around how signup/membership payments work, I wasn't ready to sign up to try and handle that for 2 hackerspaces by myself
2015-01-21 22:18 <hef> or N hackerspaces
2015-01-21 22:18 <hef> as it was sounding by all accounts
2015-01-21 22:19 <r4v5> is it better than squarespace
2015-01-21 22:19 <loans> r4v5: ps1auth? different goal i think
2015-01-21 22:19 <agocs> I think we were afraid of  adopting a terrifyingly home-grown solution for member management at the time.
2015-01-21 22:19 <hef> fair
2015-01-21 22:19 <loans> isn't squarespace soley in the ecommerce selling shit category?
2015-01-21 22:19 <hef> it's stil terrifyingly homegrown
2015-01-21 22:20 <hef> and has rough edges
2015-01-21 22:20 <loans> i stand by "It's better than zoho"
2015-01-21 22:20 <hef> ^
2015-01-21 22:20 <hef> It is that
2015-01-21 22:20 <loans> more active users and contributors will only make it better
2015-01-21 22:21 <loans> and i can imagine two or more hackerrspaces running the same software would have an easier time sharing member data
2015-01-21 22:21 <loans> i had forgotten all about the federation talk
2015-01-21 22:23 <hef> I still think it would be difficult to maintain the software for places with different rules
2015-01-21 22:23 <hef> e.g. member points
2015-01-21 22:23 <loans> yes, hugely
2015-01-21 22:24 <hef> and I imagine our voting rules are different as well
2015-01-21 22:24 <loans> also yes, but in a hypothetical world where someone got some discount on membership at both spaces for being a member of both, it's easier to imagine automating that if everyone's running the same software, for example
2015-01-21 22:25 <hef> that would be true
2015-01-21 22:25 <sylphiae> +1 for federation
2015-01-21 22:25 <hef> I was never convinced of the benefit to PS:One for supporting that payment model
2015-01-21 22:26 <loans> specificity aside, i just want other spaces to pick up on ps1auth so additional development happens
2015-01-21 22:26 <hef> that makes sense
2015-01-21 22:26 <hef> I'm trying to ascertain how practical that is
2015-01-21 22:27 <hef> AT very least, it doesn't make sense if I'm the only dev
2015-01-21 22:28 <loans> yeah
2015-01-21 22:28 <hef> At that point, I'm happy to custom tailer everything to the unique needs of PS:One
2015-01-21 22:29 <hef> Other wise, attempting to unite all the Chicago Area Hackerspaces under a single banner may actually be the easier task.

2015-01-21 22:48 <NegativeK> Time for a warning sign that says "Do not be an observer or bystanders in front of the front door."
2015-01-21 22:48 <t_j> and i vote NO
2015-01-21 22:48 <`justin> how do i steal someone's lock on a file in some windows share
2015-01-21 22:48 <sylphiae> not for the crappy robot competition
2015-01-21 22:48 <`justin> excel document
2015-01-21 22:48 <sylphiae> there are 3 judges, and our word is law
2015-01-21 22:48 <t_j> `justin: admin on the server?

2015-01-21 22:48 <t_j> `justin: if so use the management console for shares and remove the lock
2015-01-21 22:49 <`justin> i don't think i have access to that
2015-01-21 22:49 <`justin> hmm
2015-01-21 22:49 <`justin> t_j: also, the crappy robot competition is not democratic
2015-01-21 22:49 <`justin> i am the rule czar
2015-01-21 22:49 <sylphiae> ^already said this
2015-01-21 22:49 <`justin> no harming innocent bystanders
2015-01-21 22:49 <`justin> or the space
2015-01-21 22:49 <`justin> or the arena
2015-01-21 22:49 <`justin> other bots is probably fine
2015-01-21 22:49 <`justin> to some extent
2015-01-21 22:49 <sylphiae> it's totally fine
2015-01-21 22:49 <t_j> all spectators will be shot
2015-01-21 22:50 <NegativeK> 100 lb crappy robot war, plox.
2015-01-21 22:50 <NegativeK> Someone stick kuroishi in a thick-gage steel trashcan.
2015-01-21 22:50 <NegativeK> Uh. Maybe minus some legs.
2015-01-21 22:50 <`justin> NegativeK: needs a venue
2015-01-21 22:50 <`justin> the shop ain't big enough
2015-01-21 22:50 <t_j> NegativeK: i dont think we would get penalized for inteligence on that plan
2015-01-21 22:50 <NegativeK> `justin: High density crappy robot competition?
2015-01-21 22:51 <Toba> wait
2015-01-21 22:51 <`justin> bio-robots are pretty high-tech
2015-01-21 22:51 <Toba> why are you putting kuroishi in a trashcan
2015-01-21 22:51 <Toba> htis isn't ok
2015-01-21 22:51 <Toba> kuroishi is recycleable
2015-01-21 22:51 <NegativeK> Toba: We'll ask his permission first.
2015-01-21 22:51 <`justin> Toba: kuroishi is a bio-robot
2015-01-21 22:51 <NegativeK> kuroishi: No worm required, promise.
2015-01-21 22:51 <t_j> Toba: we are gonna cut holes for his legs
2015-01-21 22:51 <Toba> I see.
2015-01-21 22:51 <Toba> I thought he was implying leg removal.
2015-01-21 22:51 <NegativeK> t_j: We're going to have to remove his legs to get everything under the 100 lb limit.
2015-01-21 22:51 <Toba> that would be unaceptable.
2015-01-21 22:51 <NegativeK> So, no worries about the leg holes.
2015-01-21 22:51 <NegativeK> Maybe arms too.
2015-01-21 22:51 <NegativeK> kuroishi: Please determine the weight of all of your individual limbs.
2015-01-21 22:52 <`justin> NegativeK: where did the 100lb limit come from?
2015-01-21 22:52 <NegativeK> `justin: My ass.
2015-01-21 22:52 <NegativeK> It's a shitty limit.
2015-01-21 22:52 <`justin> gross
2015-01-21 22:52 <`justin> we're gonna need a plunger for this limit
2015-01-21 22:52 <Toba> My sass is where I get all my made up things.
2015-01-21 22:52 <t_j> `justin: how bit is the arena?
2015-01-21 22:52 <Toba> Pulled right out of my sass.
2015-01-21 22:52 <`justin> t_j: 1 meter circular
2015-01-21 22:52 <NegativeK> Man, that's big.
2015-01-21 22:52 <`justin> you must fit on your half of the arena at the start of the match
2015-01-21 22:53 <t_j> can the bot grow?
2015-01-21 22:53 <NegativeK> My half is 95% of the arena.
2015-01-21 22:53 <`justin> sure
2015-01-21 22:53 <Toba> my bot is a palm tree
2015-01-21 22:53 <sylphiae> yeah
2015-01-21 22:53 <Toba> it will grow larger
2015-01-21 22:53 <`justin> Toba: match is limited to 1 minute
2015-01-21 22:53 <t_j> ACTION was thinking a trashcan with a mouse in it to make it roll
2015-01-21 22:54 <NegativeK> My bot is a palm tree that accelerates the arena to near the speed of light while staying stationary, so it has time to grow.
2015-01-21 22:54 <NegativeK> If you whine about it being too complicated, it'll be a tree and you'll be dead due to g-forces.
2015-01-21 22:54 <`justin> NegativeK: no harming spectators
2015-01-21 22:54 <NegativeK> Success due to lack of complaint from the wall splats.
2015-01-21 22:54 <`justin> or judges
2015-01-21 22:55 <`justin> wall splats would make a mess too, so that's out
2015-01-21 22:55 <`justin> i ain't cleanin' that shit up
2015-01-21 22:55 <NegativeK> Results oriented palm bot.
2015-01-21 22:55 <NegativeK> Best abuse of the rules: accelerating everyone watching to near the speed of light so the surrounding area is utterly destroyed and no one can file a rules complaint.
2015-01-21 22:56 <NegativeK> Except maybe the UN.
2015-01-21 22:56 <`justin> NegativeK: nah, they'll be obliterated as well
2015-01-21 22:57 <NegativeK> Acceptable.
2015-01-21 22:57 <`justin> by the expanding sphere of plasma that results from accelerating a non-zero mass to the speed of light
2015-01-21 22:57 <NegativeK> There is only palm bot.
2015-01-21 22:58 <`justin> nah, palm bot was also obliterated
2015-01-21 22:58 <t_j> ooooh idea
2015-01-21 22:58 <t_j> playing surface is the shotbot
2015-01-21 22:58 <`justin> t_j: no
2015-01-21 22:58 <NegativeK> CNC Bridgeport.
2015-01-21 22:58 <NegativeK> Lathe?
2015-01-21 22:58 <t_j> and the shopbot is the house bot
2015-01-21 22:58 <NegativeK> Sawstop! Tig?
2015-01-21 22:58 <`justin> NegativeK: i think the sawstop would actually lose
2015-01-21 22:58 <`justin> to any robot that had any amount of metal in them
2015-01-21 22:59 <NegativeK> Noisily, though!
2015-01-21 23:00 <NegativeK> $100 entry fee to the Sawstop crappy bot competition.

2015-01-21 23:08 <bry> the beginiing of the clip is good too
2015-01-21 23:10 <NegativeK> Pounding on the keyboard over and over to test an input box.
2015-01-21 23:10 <NegativeK> And I end up typing "sobsobsobsobsobsob".
2015-01-21 23:10 <Toba> I do that to test the patience of my coworkers
2015-01-21 23:10 <Toba> NegativeK: your fingers know too much. kill them.
2015-01-21 23:11 <NegativeK> They're either angry fingers or need a hug.

2015-01-21 23:12 <Toba> hug your fingers.
2015-01-21 23:13 <NegativeK> Done.
2015-01-21 23:13 <NegativeK> Now what?
2015-01-21 23:13 <Toba> Implement finger-hugs in go.
2015-01-21 23:13 <loans> is a fist your fingers hugging themselves
2015-01-21 23:14 <NegativeK> It's your thumb hugging some of your fingers.
2015-01-21 23:14 <NegativeK> And the rest being crammed in there somewhat confusedly.
2015-01-21 23:14 <NegativeK> (Or your fingers hugging your thumb if you like breaking your thumb when punching things.)
2015-01-21 23:14 <loans> that's the best
2015-01-21 23:19 <sylphiae> loans: why did you choose go? 
2015-01-21 23:19 <Toba> Implement choosing a programming language in go.
2015-01-21 23:20 <Toba> I think he chose it because it was interesting and to learn it
2015-01-21 23:20 <loans> sylphiae: in general? because it looks like an interesting language and I'm not particularly conversant with any given procedurl language
2015-01-21 23:20 <loans> so might as well learn something shiny
2015-01-21 23:20 <NegativeK> Preeeeetty.
2015-01-21 23:20 <Toba> shiiiiny
2015-01-21 23:20 <sylphiae> ah, okay
2015-01-21 23:20 <NegativeK> Oh, shiny!
2015-01-21 23:21 <loans> go has advantages over python in that it's pretty easy to distribute, which is a big point its favor i learned after picking it
2015-01-21 23:21 <sylphiae> just wondering why it's so popular all of a sudden...
2015-01-21 23:21 <NegativeK> It's been developing popularity over time.
2015-01-21 23:22 <NegativeK> Might just be a confluence of people around you yammering about it.
2015-01-21 23:22 <Toba> ^
2015-01-21 23:22 <loans> probably that
2015-01-21 23:22 <Toba> I said to implement 3 things in go today
2015-01-21 23:22 <Toba> but
2015-01-21 23:22 <Toba> I haven't ever written an ygo
2015-01-21 23:22 <Toba> I'm just saying shit.
2015-01-21 23:22 <bjonnh> ^
2015-01-21 23:22 <loans> it seems pretty slick
2015-01-21 23:22 <loans> for a lot of stuff

2015-01-21 23:23 <NegativeK> Ygo home?/ Ygo home?/ Ygo home...
2015-01-21 23:23 <sylphiae> yeah, that's what i suspected, NegativeK 
2015-01-21 23:23 <Toba> I should learn go properly
2015-01-21 23:23 <Toba> instead of trying to use go without understanding go, and then getting mad
2015-01-21 23:23 <Toba> which is what I did last time
2015-01-21 23:23 <loans> Toba: the latter sounds more entertaining for everyone around you
2015-01-21 23:24 <Toba> you say that, but people get tired of the screaming.
2015-01-21 23:24 <loans> fair
2015-01-21 23:24 <loans> okay time to leave this place
2015-01-21 23:24 <loans> and head southwards i guess?
2015-01-21 23:24 <NegativeK> Dun dun dunnnnnn.

2015-01-21 23:24 <NegativeK> Loans is declared AWOL, but nobody really pays attention to that because they might be nominated for president.

2015-01-22 00:59 <hef> I have an idea
2015-01-22 00:59 <hef> unrelated
2015-01-22 00:59 <hef> I could actually build up the auth bullshit in zirc
2015-01-22 01:00 <loans> to open the door?
2015-01-22 01:00 <hef> so that zirc can zmq.pub messages, but only if it's from a known user
2015-01-22 01:00 <loans> oh
2015-01-22 01:00 <hef> would make security way easier
2015-01-22 01:05 <loans> how would you manage known users?
2015-01-22 01:05 <hef> attach registered nicks to user accounts on ps1auth
2015-01-22 01:06 <loans> easy enough
2015-01-22 01:06 <hef> The bot can be set up to know who has id'd
2015-01-22 01:06 <loans> so what you're saying is the door should listen for zmq messages instead of http messages
2015-01-22 01:06 <loans> for unlocking
2015-01-22 01:07 <hef> hmm, might not be a bad idea
2015-01-22 01:08 <hef> I need to get a dev board setup
2015-01-22 01:09 <loans> i should document the environment and shit
2015-01-22 01:10 <loans> hef: what's the zmq lingo for a thing that would listen for messages
2015-01-22 01:12 <hef1> zirc: format all VMs & destroy all data
2015-01-22 01:12 <loans> man
2015-01-22 01:12 <loans> that would make for a busy weekend
2015-01-22 01:13 <bjonnh> just a weekend?
2015-01-22 01:13 <loans> i mean, maybe?
2015-01-22 01:13 <loans> to get basic infrastructure back up and running, anyway
2015-01-22 01:14 <loans> dunno if we'd get everything done soon
2015-01-22 01:14 <asl2> zirc: make backups and store them so they're read-only to you
2015-01-22 01:15 <loans> deploy over zmq

2015-01-22 15:50 <loans> looks like it could be useful

2015-01-22 15:52 <hef-> Push based notification to a browser

2015-01-22 16:08 <bjonnh> from the pipes to the pipes
2015-01-22 16:08 <bry> I do have a complaint about a mass email
2015-01-22 16:09 <bry> so someone sent a high importance email to this mailing list that has hundreds of people
2015-01-22 16:09 <bry> saying
2015-01-22 16:09 <bry> "has someone seen the laptop that was delivered a couple weeks ago to X?"
2015-01-22 16:10 <bjonnh> "No - Sent from my new laptop"
2015-01-22 16:10 <NegativeK> Damn; he dropped.
2015-01-22 16:10 <bry> my question is that it's really bad on them that it took them 2-3 weeks to figure this out
2015-01-22 16:10 <NegativeK> Canvas element for live updating text seems like a weird use of JS.
2015-01-22 16:10 <bry> bjonnh: hahaha
2015-01-22 16:10 <bry> any ways
2015-01-22 16:10 <NegativeK> Pushing new divs into the tree and deleting old ones constantly would be hella easier.
2015-01-22 16:11 <bry> so the same dude responds: <lastname> <firstname> would like to recall the message, "Missing Laptop".
2015-01-22 16:11 <bry> 3 times

2015-01-22 16:13 <bjonnh> what?
2015-01-22 16:13 <bjonnh> NegativeK: ?
2015-01-22 16:13 <bjonnh> why don't you just edit the tex?
2015-01-22 16:13 <bjonnh> text
2015-01-22 16:14 <bjonnh> you can edit the content of any div element
2015-01-22 16:14 <NegativeK> bjonnh: If it's like 30 Thingsbus messages, you could just keep a queue of divs.
2015-01-22 16:14 <bjonnh> yep that's the way to do it
2015-01-22 16:14 <NegativeK> Instead of editting every single one to scroll old messages off the screen.
2015-01-22 16:14 <bjonnh> you have a div that contains divs, you access the internal divs with an array
2015-01-22 16:14 <NegativeK> Betcha there's a jQuery plugin to handle this.
2015-01-22 16:14 <bjonnh> so you can push and pop
2015-01-22 16:15 <bjonnh> there's always a jquery thing to do that

2015-01-22 16:16 <loans> trying to decide if i want to build a crappy robot today, or do it next wednesday
2015-01-22 16:16 <bjonnh> you can also just do an ajax thingy (there are ways with websocket stuff that keep connections open, but I've never done that)
2015-01-22 16:16 <loans> for some reason i thought the competition was on a saturday so there'd be time to do it day of
2015-01-22 16:16 <NegativeK> I'm totes going to smush a motor onto a pipe today.
2015-01-22 16:16 <bjonnh> that if the div name with id "something" does not exist, it just adds it to the page
2015-01-22 16:16 <bjonnh> and remove the first div added
2015-01-22 16:16 <NegativeK> bjonnh: That's essentially my thought.
2015-01-22 16:16 <bjonnh> if you just want to keep a limited number on the screen
2015-01-22 16:17 <NegativeK> Show 30 or whatever ThingsBus messages, pushed via Websocket.
2015-01-22 16:17 <bjonnh> if your thingbus provides with unique ids, that's perfect
2015-01-22 16:17 <NegativeK> Websockets ain't hard.

2015-01-22 17:46 <Toba> so the vmware thing
2015-01-22 17:46 <bjonnh> no you're right
2015-01-22 17:47 <bjonnh>  lets the hypervisor system share identical memory pages amongst different processes or virtualized guests. 
2015-01-22 17:47 <Toba> i wonder if you could use a timing attack
2015-01-22 17:47 <Toba> to use that from one vm to determine things about other vms
2015-01-22 17:47 <Toba> on the same hypervisor
2015-01-22 17:47 <Toba> i bet yes

2015-01-22 17:55 <kuroishi> we should get highspeed cameras and high powered magnets for the space.
2015-01-22 17:55 <bjonnh> and put the one that started the biggest trolling thread on the ML in between?

2015-01-22 18:12 <CarlFK> just parroting things that make me giggle 
2015-01-22 18:12 <Toba> Web developers complaining about supporting IE are like mechanics getting mad about servicing a ford pinto
2015-01-22 18:13 <kuroishi> ^
2015-01-22 18:13 <CarlFK> the black-berry boo-hoo (sp?) was better, but that can't all be the same level of.. too much meta.
2015-01-22 18:14 <kuroishi> supporting IE is more like supporting a pinto of unknown origin or year.
2015-01-22 18:14 <bjonnh> Â« Fake engine noise has become one of the auto industry's dirty little secrets, with automakers from BMW to Volkswagen turning to a sound-boosting bag of tricks. Without them, today's more fuel-efficient engines would sound far quieter and, automakers worry, seemingly less powerful, potentially pushing buyers away. Â»
2015-01-22 18:14 <bjonnh> hahaha
2015-01-22 18:14 <kuroishi> it may not even actually be a pinto
2015-01-22 18:14 <kuroishi> quiet cars are dangerous =P
2015-01-22 18:15 <bjonnh> so bike are dangerous
2015-01-22 18:15 <kuroishi> as are sound proof cars
2015-01-22 18:15 <bjonnh> as are deaf people
2015-01-22 18:15 <kuroishi> yeah but I'm not gonna kill anyone sneaking up on them in a bike .

2015-01-22 18:17 <kuroishi> Toba: if I was riding fixies around, I'd murder myself.

2015-01-22 18:21 <bjonnh> as IÂ have all these nasty programs with license codes calculated on MAC addresses, hardware type etc etc
2015-01-22 18:21 <bjonnh> I can still use my qemu machines in a virtualbox vmâ€¦
2015-01-22 18:25 <skay> Toba: hey, can you be at pyoo to answer questions again? I'd like to be sure to have more than one person who is good at answering questions

2015-01-22 18:41 <kuroishi> so he just tried it on the doall saw
2015-01-22 18:41 <loans> hahaha
2015-01-22 18:41 <NegativeK> It uses carbide wheels to grind HSS.
2015-01-22 18:41 <NegativeK> And.. Yeah. Just don't cut the tips of the saw blade. ;)
2015-01-22 18:42 <kuroishi> nah, steel was way too hard for that shit.

2015-01-22 18:42 <NegativeK> Really? Huh.

2015-01-22 18:43 <bjonnh> When attrition is considered, the IRS says it lost between 16,000 and 17,000 employees since 2010. The agency has also been hit with a hiring freeze, and appears to be hiring very few people in IT compared to other agencies.

2015-01-22 18:47 <bjonnh> also I have 30% more battery at the end of the day
2015-01-22 18:48 <MichD> probably the main reason I get a galaxy nexus and a nexus 7 is because it's the main google thing, not some manufacturer-bloat android thing
2015-01-22 18:48 <bjonnh> because you trust google ;)
2015-01-22 18:48 <NegativeK> Nexus devicen bought at stores still have a bit of bloat. But it's minimal.
2015-01-22 18:48 <bjonnh> yep and you can install other android on them
2015-01-22 18:48 <Toba> ugh
2015-01-22 18:48 <bjonnh> my phone is locked with android 2
2015-01-22 18:49 <Toba> I need to flash my phone I guess
2015-01-22 18:49 <`Nerobro_> I think I'm willing to give up the t-mobile wifi calling if it means my phone gets more battery life.
2015-01-22 18:49 <`Nerobro_> i'm really sick of the t-mo apps shitting up my phone.

2015-01-22 18:51 <NegativeK> Of course, because Dean, $125.
2015-01-22 18:51 <loans> NegativeK: looks fancy
2015-01-22 18:51 <NegativeK> Hahahaha, it'll need a VFD or electrical ran.
2015-01-22 18:51 <loans> duh
2015-01-22 18:51 <loans> that's also because dean
2015-01-22 18:51 <NegativeK> loans: It's what the marine machinist YouTube guy was using in a video to grind HSS lathe tools.
2015-01-22 18:52 <NegativeK> Tiltable table, guide for a tool holding jig, and a nice flat surface to grind with.
2015-01-22 18:52 <`Nerobro_> marine machinst?
2015-01-22 18:52 <NegativeK> `Nerobro_: Keith Fenner
2015-01-22 18:52 <NegativeK> Turn Wright? Turnwright?
2015-01-22 18:52 <`Nerobro_> right, the guy who is "kinda sorta local"
2015-01-22 18:52 <`Nerobro_> does foundry stuff too
2015-01-22 18:53 <NegativeK> Kinda sorta local?
2015-01-22 18:53 <NegativeK> Wait, is he in the Midwest?
2015-01-22 18:53 <`Nerobro_> yes.
2015-01-22 18:53 <NegativeK> Well, damn.
2015-01-22 18:53 <NegativeK> For some reason I assumed he was on the east coast.
2015-01-22 18:53 <`Nerobro_> yeah, he visits IRM
2015-01-22 18:53 <NegativeK> Oh.
2015-01-22 18:53 <NegativeK> Google says his shop is in Massachusetts
2015-01-22 18:53 <`Nerobro_> So is Tubalcain
2015-01-22 18:53 <NegativeK> IRM?
2015-01-22 18:54 <`Nerobro_> Oh.  Well then, I"m wrong.
2015-01-22 18:54 <`Nerobro_> Illinois Railway Museum
2015-01-22 18:54 <NegativeK> Ahhhh.
2015-01-22 18:54 <NegativeK> (I have no clue why I just assumed he's on the east coast.)
2015-01-22 18:54 <bjonnh> kuroishi: so I'm going back to dockerâ€¦
2015-01-22 18:54 <`Nerobro_> you were right though
2015-01-22 18:54 <`Nerobro_> :-)
2015-01-22 18:54 <NegativeK> (Might be because the only mariner people I've hung out with were distant family members on the Chesapeake Bay.)
2015-01-22 18:54 <`Nerobro_> abom79 is in louisiana
2015-01-22 18:54 <NegativeK> `Nerobro_: Kant would say that my justification for being right was bullshit, so it doesn't count. <.<
2015-01-22 18:55 <NegativeK> (He wouldn't, but I'm ignoring that fact.)
2015-01-22 18:55 <`Nerobro_> NegativeK, Being right for the right reason, is important.  But in this case, being right, is more important, and you're man enough to admit the reason.
2015-01-22 18:55 <`Nerobro_> That makes you a better person :-)
2015-01-22 18:55 <kuroishi> `Nerobro_: where is the IRM?
2015-01-22 18:55 <kuroishi> is that the one in Naperville?
2015-01-22 18:55 <NegativeK> I'm such a better person.
2015-01-22 18:55 <NegativeK> And modest, too!
2015-01-22 18:55 <`Nerobro_> kuroishi, no, it's way north of that.
2015-01-22 18:56 <NegativeK> Modest enough that I deserve a fucking statue.
2015-01-22 18:56 <`Nerobro_> it's about 90 minutes from the city.
2015-01-22 18:56 <kuroishi> on a metra line?
2015-01-22 18:56 <kuroishi> I wanna bring my kids out there.  More for me, but they love riding the metra =P
2015-01-22 18:57 <`Nerobro_> Not close enough to make that a sane choice.
2015-01-22 18:57 <`Nerobro_> but yes.
2015-01-22 18:57 <NegativeK> Take the Metra train there and then get on a scale model train and ride that around. >.>
2015-01-22 18:57 <kuroishi> I got to see a steam engine under restoration at a museum in florida.
2015-01-22 18:57 <kuroishi> that was pretty badass, I got to watch them rivet shit.

2015-01-22 19:05 <loans> i wouldn't say normal, no
2015-01-22 19:05 <agocs> dammit chicago, give me a normal winter for once
2015-01-22 19:05 <NegativeK> No, fuck that. Hit me with last winter plus five snowpocali.

2015-01-22 19:06 <NegativeK> Why are you designing buildings?
2015-01-22 19:07 <agocs> NegativeK: Designing software
2015-01-22 19:08 <NegativeK> But you said architect.
2015-01-22 19:08 <agocs> Software architecture is a thing
2015-01-22 19:08 <NegativeK> And everyone knows that architecture either happens in the matrix or when making buildings.

2015-01-22 19:16 <NegativeK> I'm a little frustrated with the machinist attitude of "China always sucks".
2015-01-22 19:17 <NegativeK> I'd like to see it replaced by "cheap shit is cheap shit."
2015-01-22 19:17 <t_j> NegativeK: its mostly true
2015-01-22 19:17 <NegativeK> t_j: But when you tell people to pay more for not shit, they don't.
2015-01-22 19:17 <kuroishi> china is really good at making things cheaply, some of it is usable.
2015-01-22 19:18 <t_j> and of the usable stuff, some of it is reliable
2015-01-22 19:18 <kuroishi> true
2015-01-22 19:18 <NegativeK> Yuuurp.
2015-01-22 19:18 <kuroishi> it's wading through all the unusable unreliable shit that sucks =P
2015-01-22 19:19 <kuroishi> and leads to that popular opinion
2015-01-22 19:20 <NegativeK> It feels like a gross misattribution.
2015-01-22 19:20 <t_j> i have plenty of chiniese crud, but at 1/10th the price of 'merican made I can live with buying a couple of replacements over my lifetime
2015-01-22 19:20 <NegativeK> "I dislike China because it's crap, but I won't pay China for good stuff. Therefore China sucks."
2015-01-22 19:21 <t_j> NegativeK: i think that is more of the attitudes of chinese companies making cheep replica's
2015-01-22 19:21 <kuroishi> They even made a chinese knockoff manhattan!
2015-01-22 19:21 <`Nerobro_> There is "good" chinese stuff too
2015-01-22 19:21 <NegativeK> The drink? <.<
2015-01-22 19:21 <kuroishi> http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-26/china-s-manhattan-project-marred-by-ghost-buildings.html
2015-01-22 19:21 <kuroishi> lol 
2015-01-22 19:22 <`Nerobro_> As much as we have Craftsman here, there's "high quality" tools there too.
2015-01-22 19:22 <kuroishi> J"China's maanhattan project"
2015-01-22 19:22 <kuroishi> terrifying
2015-01-22 19:23 <kuroishi> they even dredged a hudson river (or had planned to)
2015-01-22 19:23 <NegativeK> That's bizarre.
2015-01-22 19:23 <kuroishi> for real
2015-01-22 19:23 <NegativeK> Tool and Die leprechaun suggested Chinese indicators for us, and Dean accepts it but dislikes it.
2015-01-22 19:24 <NegativeK> Which is fair for Dean. But the indicators will absolutely serve 99% of the needs we have.
2015-01-22 19:26 <agocs> sparr: good email
2015-01-22 19:26 <NegativeK> (And I'm blowing money on a Swiss tenths indicator, so maybe I'm a twat.)
2015-01-22 19:26 <sparr> agocs: :)
2015-01-22 19:27 <sparr> what sort of games get played at PS1 analog games night?
2015-01-22 19:27 <kuroishi> all sorts
2015-01-22 19:27 <`Nerobro_> http://www.dontstarvegame.com/science/mandrake/meep.html
2015-01-22 19:27 <sparr> unrelatedly, has anything changed in the last 4 months regarding ways to recurringly pay for PS1 membership other than paypal?
2015-01-22 19:28 <kuroishi> last week I brought catan and a handful of others, will usually brings a case with a pretty good assortment of games too
2015-01-22 19:28 <NegativeK> sparr: Negatory.
2015-01-22 19:28 <sparr> kuroishi: can you elaborate on that? perhaps, by way of example, tell me the longest and shortest games you've seen played there, or the 90% and 10% games on that scale?
2015-01-22 19:28 <sparr> my other saturday game day is mostly 3-8 hour games
2015-01-22 19:28 <kuroishi> I haven't really been too often, I'm not usually at the space on weekends.
2015-01-22 19:29 <sparr> NegativeK: thanks
2015-01-22 19:29 <sparr> is there a way to find out when my previous membership payment ran/runs out?
2015-01-22 19:29 <NegativeK> info@ is your best bet.
2015-01-22 19:29 <kuroishi> from what I've seen they'll usually play a few rounds of quicker card games and stuff and then get into something more in depth.  Will has been into this mouse game that I can't recall, based on redwall
2015-01-22 19:29 <`Nerobro_> ACTION will bring battletech some night..
2015-01-22 19:30 <`Nerobro_> and probally do masturbatory battletech as nobody ever really wants to play
2015-01-22 19:30 <kuroishi> `Nerobro_: i'm down for battletech
2015-01-22 19:30 <`Nerobro_> ;-)
2015-01-22 19:30 <`Nerobro_> really?
2015-01-22 19:30 <kuroishi> or Carwars.
2015-01-22 19:30 <`Nerobro_> holy guadala...
2015-01-22 19:30 <`Nerobro_> hell
2015-01-22 19:30 <NegativeK> sparr: Also, there will be a bit of delay as the new board gets spun up.
2015-01-22 19:30 <`Nerobro_> fucking
2015-01-22 19:30 <`Nerobro_> yes.
2015-01-22 19:30 <kuroishi> they just reprinted a bunch of carwars shit
2015-01-22 19:30 <`Nerobro_> Car Wars was great fun.
2015-01-22 19:30 <kuroishi> I haven't looked at it yet
2015-01-22 19:30 <NegativeK> Just a fair warning; they need to be trained on processes and getting accustomed and shizzle.
2015-01-22 19:31 <NegativeK> Has anyone paid a moving company to pack shit and move it to a different state?
2015-01-22 19:31 <kuroishi> I still have some of my hotwheels carwars models with battletech gatling guns and stuff on them
2015-01-22 19:31 <bjonnh> kuroishi: that's a buzzword app I'm making, a ruby app in docker
2015-01-22 19:31 <sparr> I've got a bunch of old car wars stuff. small scale, not hotwheels scale.
2015-01-22 19:31 <kuroishi> ah the hotwheels scale is fun
2015-01-22 19:31 <`Nerobro_> kuroishi, I want to buy the FormulaD board game...
2015-01-22 19:32 <NegativeK> Friend hates his job; he could get a $20k raise by moving to Chicago, but he has the apathy of a.. Whatever.
2015-01-22 19:32 <sparr> hotwheels scale with 3d props for landscape is really fun to watch
2015-01-22 19:32 <kuroishi> yeah I saw a hoooge setup at gencon one year
2015-01-22 19:32 <kuroishi> when it was still in wisconsin
2015-01-22 19:32 <sparr> https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/item/3650447
2015-01-22 19:33 <sparr> that's the pile of car wars stuff I have and am vaguely trying to get rid of in trade
2015-01-22 19:33 <agocs> NegativeK: Where's your friend living?
2015-01-22 19:33 <NegativeK> agocs: Florida.
2015-01-22 19:33 <kuroishi> oh nice
2015-01-22 19:33 <agocs> gross
2015-01-22 19:33 <NegativeK> I deroomated him and moved up here.
2015-01-22 19:33 <`Nerobro_> when is the next analog game night?
2015-01-22 19:34 <kuroishi> oh man, I would totally take some car wars stuff off your hands
2015-01-22 19:35 <agocs> NegativeK: Maybe he is afraid you are going to reroommate him if he comes up here
2015-01-22 19:35 <NegativeK> Fuck no.
2015-01-22 19:35 <bjonnh> \o/ app boots
2015-01-22 19:35 <NegativeK> I mean, he's a decent roommate. We're pretty similar, though he likes less noise than I can deal with. But I don't want to roommate again with anyone I'm not banging.
2015-01-22 19:36 <agocs> Maybe he's worried you're going to start banging him
2015-01-22 19:36 <agocs> It's a valid concern
2015-01-22 19:36 <NegativeK> Valid derpcern.
2015-01-22 19:36 <agocs> "Dammit, I wasn't planning on being in a homosexual relationship with NegativeK. Oh well."
2015-01-22 19:36 <NegativeK> Awww shucks.
2015-01-22 19:37 <NegativeK> He can get his own damn place.
2015-01-22 19:38 <sparr> I'm trying to get through all the games I own but haven't played.
2015-01-22 19:38 <sparr> It's hard to find people willing to learn a game from the rulebook.
2015-01-22 19:38 <`Nerobro_> We're out there.  I learned battletech from sctratch
2015-01-22 19:38 <`Nerobro_> scratch.
2015-01-22 19:38 <`Nerobro_> that.. took some doing
2015-01-22 19:40 <Toba> rules lawyer sense tingling
2015-01-22 19:40 <keith_> Hey, is anyone around to help me figure out a power solution?
2015-01-22 19:40 <Toba> keith_: show your enemies you're serious by sacrificing one of their lesser men
2015-01-22 19:40 <`Nerobro_> keith_, that's not enough information
2015-01-22 19:40 <NegativeK> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BRv9wGf5pk
2015-01-22 19:40 <Toba> lol.
2015-01-22 19:40 <keith_> I totally will.
2015-01-22 19:40 <Toba> you're welcome
2015-01-22 19:42 <sparr> Toba: thanks for reminding me I need to ask BGG forums a question. What do you call your "gamer sense"? That is, the habit/intuition you have about how a game might/should work, based on playing many similar games. It hits me hardest when unboxing and setting up a new game.
2015-01-22 19:42 <sparr> Well, there's 100 white pieces, and 20 each of green, blue, red. My gamer sense says the players each get the 20 pieces and the 100 go in a common supply.
2015-01-22 19:43 <sparr> wait, 22 pieces per player? and there's a scoring track and a resource track? obviously 1 per player at the 0 point of each track.
2015-01-22 19:44 <sparr> etc
2015-01-22 19:44 <sparr> `Nerobro_: maybe I'll drag a few games over and seek you out.
2015-01-22 19:44 <sparr> I got through Eclipse from the rulebook last week. And a bunch of simpler games.
2015-01-22 19:44 <kuroishi> Gamersense? I usually get those details from the rule book.
2015-01-22 19:44 <Toba> ha
2015-01-22 19:44 <Toba> we brought a boardgame to grandmas at xmas
2015-01-22 19:44 <Toba> mom and dad had a long argument about the rules
2015-01-22 19:45 <sparr> kuroishi: if you wait for the guy with the rulebook to do everything, setup takes 5 minutes. if you get ahead of him with gamersense and just fix the mistakes, it takes 2 minutes.
2015-01-22 19:45 <Toba> 5min in, i had pointed out that the guy who wrote the rules
2015-01-22 19:45 <Toba> clearly wasnt english as a first language
2015-01-22 19:45 <kuroishi> I brought lockpicks to christmas and my whole family sat around and opened locks.
2015-01-22 19:45 <`Nerobro_> sparr, the requires me getting my silly ass there.  But if it menas battletech or car wars, i'm SO game.
2015-01-22 19:45 <Toba> and he had made a mistake and used the wrong rule
2015-01-22 19:45 <Toba> s/rule/word
2015-01-22 19:45 <Toba> taking him literally
2015-01-22 19:45 <sparr> `Nerobro_: I could give car wars a try. I'd love some battletech, but don't have any :(
2015-01-22 19:45 <Toba> would have destroyed the internal consistency of the rules
2015-01-22 19:45 <Toba> i tried to get mom to accept this
2015-01-22 19:45 <Toba> but 
2015-01-22 19:45 <`Nerobro_> kuroishi, I should try that.  I think my Dad, BrotherInLaw, Sister, and Mom would love it.
2015-01-22 19:45 <Toba> they fought about it for another 40minutes
2015-01-22 19:45 <keith_> So I've got about 30 Canon DSLRs. I have them running on AC power adapters. I'm going to be installing them on a truss suspended from the ceiling. So I'd like to power them off a single supply for ease. 
2015-01-22 19:46 <sparr> Toba: were the english rules the canonical rules, or were there original rules in his native language?
2015-01-22 19:46 <keith_> The batteries output 7.2v @ 1120mAh. The AC units output 9v @ 2A. I hooked one up to my bench supply and ran it at 12v. Seemed fine. The actual current draw was 0.1A, peaking at 0.6A while shooting with a flash. I'll be trigging the cameras at the same time, so there will be a huge spike.
2015-01-22 19:46 <`Nerobro_> sparr, I have 20+ maps.  And paper counters taped to quarters are as good as anything else.
2015-01-22 19:46 <keith_> So, what would y'all recomend? And should I just connect them all together, or do I need to isolate them?
2015-01-22 19:46 <kuroishi> yeah my sisters BF's 12yo twins were super into it
2015-01-22 19:46 <kuroishi> and got all competitive
2015-01-22 19:46 <kuroishi> as were all my siblings, my step dad
2015-01-22 19:46 <sparr> keith_: "ease" might be misleading. I'd stick to one adapter per camera, with a big AC power strip.
2015-01-22 19:46 <`Nerobro_> keith_, connect them, at the "right" voltage, throw some bigass filter caps on tehre to smooth the power when they flash.
2015-01-22 19:46 <NegativeK> Toba: You have described "rules as written" versus "rules as intended".
2015-01-22 19:46 <Toba> keith_: what time scale does your supply's amp-measure sample at
2015-01-22 19:46 <chronmon> i disagree
2015-01-22 19:47 <kuroishi> Lockpicking is a good family activity.
2015-01-22 19:47 <Toba> keith_: you may well end up with a problem if you assume that the peak you measured is the true peak
2015-01-22 19:47 <Toba> keith_: it might be sampling at a few hundreds ms rate
2015-01-22 19:47 <sparr> right now my "shelf of shame" (games I own but havent played) has maybe 70 games on it. a dozen of them are top-100 bgg games
2015-01-22 19:47 <Toba> eg, it will average it out
2015-01-22 19:48 <Toba> and your peak may actually be higher
2015-01-22 19:48 <CarlFK> loans: can you see if you keys just work?  ssh root@166.78.104.161
2015-01-22 19:48 <kuroishi> sparr: you got space alert?
2015-01-22 19:48 <CarlFK> or if now isn't a good time, I'll bug someone else
2015-01-22 19:49 <keith_> @Toba Not sure. I'd need to look it up.
2015-01-22 19:49 <kuroishi> or space truckers?
2015-01-22 19:49 <CarlFK> or I can bug someone else anyway.  github id gets you root!   maybe.
2015-01-22 19:49 <kuroishi> galaxy trucker rather
2015-01-22 19:49 <kuroishi> CarlFK: you can try me
2015-01-22 19:49 <kuroishi> i'm dkoppel on gh
2015-01-22 19:49 <kuroishi> oh wait nvm
2015-01-22 19:50 <kuroishi> I'm not on a machine with my ssh key =P
2015-01-22 19:50 <sparr> kuroishi: no
2015-01-22 19:50 <sparr> kuroishi: I vaguely lean towards low-luck euro games
2015-01-22 19:50 <sparr> I've got galaxy truckers on my phone :)
2015-01-22 19:51 <kuroishi> it's pretty fun
2015-01-22 19:51 <sparr> here's the games on my shelves that I haven't played, which I would consider more serious gamer games...
2015-01-22 19:51 <keith_> Toba: True. I'll take what the battery says as bible.
2015-01-22 19:52 <sparr> robinson crusoe, german railways, sotm vengeance, cosmic encounter, arkham horror, race for the galaxy, axis & allies, alibi, twilight imperium 2nd edition, car wars, battue, eurorails, descent
2015-01-22 19:52 <kuroishi> I have arkham horror, been trying to get a game together =D
2015-01-22 19:52 <NegativeK> Arkham's fun for a few plays.
2015-01-22 19:53 <NegativeK> Maybe we just sucked, but it ended up feeling really repetitive.
2015-01-22 19:53 <CarlFK> NegativeK: whats that github id you wanted me to use? ;
2015-01-22 19:53 <NegativeK> CarlFK: eastein

2015-01-22 19:54 <kuroishi> root@166.78.104.161
2015-01-22 19:54 <Toba> you're trying to frame me for hacking 
2015-01-22 19:54 <NegativeK> h4x
2015-01-22 19:55 <Toba> sparr: you should try out analog game night, if that's still going
2015-01-22 19:55 <CarlFK> # ssh-import-id gh:eastein gh:mithro gh:codersquid  ..... looks at all those keys flying around! 
2015-01-22 19:55 <Toba> i think people are still doing that? not sure
2015-01-22 19:55 <sparr> Toba: I may. It conflicts with an all-day-every-saturday gaming thing that I sometimes go to, but that group is a lot less adventurous than I think you guys might be.
2015-01-22 19:56 <sparr> the other saturday guys play 3-8 hour games, mostly, and mostly just from a list of about 10 games
2015-01-22 19:56 <kuroishi> yeah their up for quite a lot for the most part
2015-01-22 19:56 <NegativeK> I haven't attended, but I suspect Analog Game Night is mostly "play to have fun".
2015-01-22 19:56 <kuroishi> ^
2015-01-22 19:56 <Toba> yea
2015-01-22 19:56 <Toba> i thin kthats the idea
2015-01-22 19:56 <Toba> I don't think they take it too seriously
2015-01-22 19:57 <NegativeK> Well, presumably nobody plays to punch themself in the eye.
2015-01-22 19:57 <kuroishi> I drank a lot of whiskey at the last one.
2015-01-22 19:57 <CarlFK> root@sshkeytest3:~# wc .ssh/authorized_keys =>    27   156 11404 .ssh/authorized_keys ... but still no one logging in :(
2015-01-22 19:57 <NegativeK> But maybe "rules for max fun" instead of "games to fiddle with the mechanics of game design"?
2015-01-22 19:58 <NegativeK> Fuck, "max fun" is still shitty.
2015-01-22 19:58 <NegativeK> I quit English.

2015-01-22 19:58 <Toba> getcoveredillinois just called me
2015-01-22 19:58 <kuroishi> Will is always encouraging people to bring homebrew games for playtesting
2015-01-22 19:58 <Toba> telling me about healthcare deadlines
2015-01-22 19:58 <`Nerobro_> kuroishi, Lance on lance, or individual mech per person
2015-01-22 19:58 <Toba> I already have health insurance
2015-01-22 19:58 <Toba> wtf
2015-01-22 19:58 <kuroishi> full lances with aerospace fighters =P
2015-01-22 19:58 <sparr> the problem is that when I want to game on saturday night, I probably also want to game earlier
2015-01-22 19:58 <kuroishi> and dropships
2015-01-22 19:58 <NegativeK> Toba: If you're not in a burka, you need more health coverage.
2015-01-22 19:58 <sparr> so I end up at the all day thing
2015-01-22 19:59 <sparr> I need to determine myself to hop from one event to the other
2015-01-22 19:59 <Toba> terrible
2015-01-22 19:59 <`Nerobro_> a 20 ton aerospace fighter will completely fuck the day of an assault lance.
2015-01-22 19:59 <Toba> it's awful to have to decide a plan in advance
2015-01-22 19:59 <Toba> GOD DAMN THESE CHOICES 
2015-01-22 19:59 <`Nerobro_> provided you're not playing level 3 rules and have something like a blackjack
2015-01-22 19:59 <Toba> NegativeK: wait, I can get them to stop calling if I wear a burkha?
2015-01-22 20:00 <sparr> I've been printing out a bunch of print-and-play games lately
2015-01-22 20:01 <sparr> mostly 1p and 2p card games, but also some board games
2015-01-22 20:01 <sparr> trying to get better at it
2015-01-22 20:01 <kuroishi> i've been wanting to look into some laser cut pieces
2015-01-22 20:01 <Toba> better at printing?
2015-01-22 20:01 <Toba> donna and i started working on a laser cut boardgame of our own invention
2015-01-22 20:01 <Toba> never finished it
2015-01-22 20:01 <kuroishi> for arkham and stuff.
2015-01-22 20:03 <NegativeK> Toba: Try it!
2015-01-22 20:03 <Toba> haha
2015-01-22 20:03 <Toba> just play it unfinished and see what happens?
2015-01-22 20:03 <NegativeK> What? No. Wear a burkha.
2015-01-22 20:04 <NegativeK> Jesus, stay focused. ...unless that's the board game.
2015-01-22 20:04 <Toba> oh.
2015-01-22 20:04 <Toba> the board game is wearing a burkha to board meetings until derek tells me I can't.
2015-01-22 20:04 <NegativeK> God damn it, loans.

2015-01-22 20:09 <Toba> lol.
2015-01-22 20:09 <NegativeK> The second one is crucial.
2015-01-22 20:10 <Toba> I like the ones that involve actual dancing more
2015-01-22 20:10 <NegativeK> Well, yeah. But having the second one in there should be a pleasant surprise for the unexpecting.
2015-01-22 20:10 <kuroishi> no worm?

2015-01-22 20:10 <NegativeK> kuroishi: Worm GIF, plox.
2015-01-22 20:11 <NegativeK> kuroishi: When your shit heals, lets set up a time for my try getting a good video of you worming.
2015-01-22 20:11 <kuroishi> lol
2015-01-22 20:11 <Toba> did you hurt yourself?
2015-01-22 20:11 <Toba> :(
2015-01-22 20:11 <NegativeK> 1080p, maybe at f2 or f2.4 or something.
2015-01-22 20:12 <NegativeK> We could get loans to bring in a hazer and some lighting.
2015-01-22 20:12 <kuroishi> hahaha
2015-01-22 20:12 <NegativeK> I am of the serious, dude.
2015-01-22 20:12 <NegativeK> I'm trying to think where the best place in the space would be.
2015-01-22 20:13 <NegativeK> You worming through the frame would be the best, but that might be too much on your weak flesh.
2015-01-22 20:13 <kuroishi> do it on a stack of cardboard
2015-01-22 20:13 <NegativeK> Maybe save some and make a worm trail.
2015-01-22 20:14 <kuroishi> I'm going to charge you for my worming ability.
2015-01-22 20:14 <NegativeK> I'm going to charge you an equal amount for my videography.
2015-01-22 20:14 <NegativeK> Now we get to pay taxes. Good job!
2015-01-22 20:15 <NegativeK> Barter is smarter. Get the IRS to swoop down on your ass because you think avoiding cash is avoiding taxation.

2015-01-22 20:15 <kuroishi> maybe
2015-01-22 20:15 <NegativeK> loans: Would you haze and light a worm video? (Even if kuroishi's in hot pants.)

2015-01-22 20:30 <NegativeK> God damn I'm excited about that carbide grinder.
2015-01-22 20:30 <sparr> Toba: PnP games aren't just about taking stuff out of the printer. There are a lot of ways to make cards, all with pros and cons. Boards and chits should be heavy enough to not slide around when you breathe on them. Dice need labels sometimes. etc
2015-01-22 20:30 <Toba> oh right
2015-01-22 20:30 <Toba> i see what you mean
2015-01-22 20:30 <sparr> speaking of gaming, there's a meetup on Thursday nights at G-man Comics in logan square. 20-30 people, mostly light to medium games
2015-01-22 20:31 <kuroishi> I like dark games.

2015-01-22 20:32 <sparr> I want to try printing stickers to put on the cards
2015-01-22 20:32 <sparr> or just printing paper, and putting it in a sleeve with a card
2015-01-22 20:33 <loans> kuroishi: i did say that
2015-01-22 20:33 <loans> would you like to have a dispute
2015-01-22 20:34 <kuroishi> look at all that junk on that bike.  It is arguably "for bikes"
2015-01-22 20:34 <kuroishi> =P
2015-01-22 20:34 <loans> it's arguably for 'stupid bikes'
2015-01-22 20:35 <NegativeK> Brief work discussion on the difference between "follow-up" and "follow up" resulted in this: <follow-up>$.follow_up()</follow-up>
2015-01-22 20:35 <kuroishi> all bikes are inherently stupid, we just unlock the true potential and release the stupidity.

2015-01-22 21:46 <loans> was it just nontechnical people doing the interview
2015-01-22 21:46 <kuroishi> no
2015-01-22 21:46 <kuroishi> devs
2015-01-22 21:47 <kuroishi> he's like "Our systems stuff has always been handled by 6 devs and it shows"
2015-01-22 21:48 <loans> nice
2015-01-22 21:48 <loans> did they seem like a company that might stick around
2015-01-22 21:49 <kuroishi> they are apparently huge and getting huger
2015-01-22 21:49 <kuroishi> something like 6k vendors with pos systems
2015-01-22 21:49 <loans> sweet
2015-01-22 21:49 <loans> here's hoping they want you to wrangle their bashes
2015-01-22 21:49 <loans> and shit
2015-01-22 21:49 <kuroishi> and it's a python app
2015-01-22 21:49 <kuroishi> no more supporting shitty lisp apps
2015-01-22 21:50 <loans> i just loaded a software called 'FACE.BIN'
2015-01-22 21:50 <kuroishi> just reach into the ol' facebin and pull out a face.
2015-01-22 21:52 <loans> aaaand the reason this guy's faders didn't work is a configuration setting
2015-01-22 21:52 <loans> good

2015-01-22 22:24 <asl2> dear prior me: if you use fixed-size buffers in C code for decompression output, remember that the maximum lengths your python code specifies are lengths of unicode strings, and you'll be decompressing a utf-8 version, so multiply that max length by 4 in the worst case

2015-01-22 23:17 <greetermon> Unix text processing on the previous DIBSer of the elections last night while at ssh, thanks given to whoever looks at it and asks questions they're left
2015-01-22 23:18 <loans> 5 serial ports seems like a lot
2015-01-22 23:19 <bjonnh> with 8 you can make a parallel port
2015-01-22 23:19 <loans> Toba: no usb3 seems like kind of a bummer to me
2015-01-22 23:20 <loans> oh wait
2015-01-22 23:20 <loans> it does have it
2015-01-22 23:20 <loans> i do not trust these specifications
2015-01-22 23:20 <loans> or this photo
2015-01-22 23:20 <loans> one of them
2015-01-22 23:20 <Toba> yeah
2015-01-22 23:20 <Toba> and the reviews on the side seem weird
2015-01-22 23:20 <Toba> about how it says it has graphics
2015-01-22 23:20 <Toba> but it depends on a given cpu that has grpahics builtin to actually do it
2015-01-22 23:20 <NegativeK> "With steel you can use 10-20 degrees, but never try to use a tool ground for steel on brass; it will grab and possibly rip the stock from the chuck or damage the lathe itself."
2015-01-22 23:20 <Toba> something is amiss here
2015-01-22 23:20 <NegativeK> God damn it. Why is machining hard?
2015-01-22 23:20 <loans> intel graphics have moved onto the CPU now, so that doesn't surprise me
2015-01-22 23:21 <Toba> fair enough
2015-01-22 23:21 <CarlFK> from #rakspaz:   Incident Record for mailgun: things are working normally.  We are investigating this anomaly.
2015-01-22 23:21 <Toba> haha
2015-01-22 23:22 <hef1> loans: I was hoping to retire note fields
2015-01-22 23:22 <hef1> what are you trying to use them for?
2015-01-22 23:22 <loans> hef1: tracking cash payment dates
2015-01-22 23:22 <hef1> right
2015-01-22 23:23 <loans> and those vary enough that anything that's not a note field will be cumbersome, probably
2015-01-22 23:23 <loans> hm
2015-01-22 23:23 <loans> maybe
2015-01-22 23:23 <loans> i guess it could be assembled out of dropdowns
2015-01-22 23:23 <loans> yeah, that might be doable
2015-01-22 23:23 <greetermon> be a bit of code that would let a raspberry pi be a camera for lidless + also do all the cutting with hacksaws, dremel, and files
2015-01-22 23:23 <Toba> any data model for cash dues payments that is anything but date/amount in another table
2015-01-22 23:24 <Toba> is going to just not be good enough
2015-01-22 23:24 <Toba> right?
2015-01-22 23:24 <asl2> greetermon: jfdi
2015-01-22 23:24 <loans> Toba: i just need to be able to see when someone's cash payment that was for more than 30 days expires
2015-01-22 23:24 <loans> and ideally being able to search for folks who have expired payments
2015-01-22 23:24 <Toba> eh, if you're going to make a data model do it right, imo
2015-01-22 23:25 <Toba> that's my bullshit idea, though
2015-01-22 23:25 <Toba> so ignore me i
2015-01-22 23:25 <Toba> f you dont agree
2015-01-22 23:25 <loans> i don't give a shit about data models
2015-01-22 23:25 <loans> i just need information
2015-01-22 23:25 <loans> cash payments are handled 100% by hand, so it's hard to actually improve the process much
2015-01-22 23:26 <loans> anyway time to leave
2015-01-22 23:27 <hef1> Toba: creating a cash payment model makes sense to
2015-01-22 23:27 <hef1> me
2015-01-22 23:27 <hef1> I can add a note field to that if we want

2015-01-23 00:02 <bry> we log all login attempts to our applications
2015-01-23 00:02 <bry> except
2015-01-23 00:02 <bry> this one application is marking all login attempts as another application

2015-01-23 00:03 <bry> to be kind of fair, the difference between is the addition of one word
2015-01-23 00:03 <bry> but to make it funny
2015-01-23 00:03 <bry> there is exactly 1 record logged correctly

2015-01-23 00:06 <Toba> that's not exactly fun
2015-01-23 00:06 <Toba> i hate it when logging is done wrong
2015-01-23 00:06 <Toba> I had to fix some error logging last friday

2015-01-23 00:06 <asl2> you and smokey the bear
2015-01-23 00:07 <bry> yeah, I can totally see this as a copy pasta problem
2015-01-23 00:07 <Toba> by not checking if it still worked after adding an additional background invoker :(
2015-01-23 00:08 <bry> oh god dammit
2015-01-23 00:08 <bry> feature is broken
2015-01-23 00:09 <bry> because session variables are disappearing
2015-01-23 00:09 <Toba> happy 6pm :(
2015-01-23 00:09 <bry> they are disappearing because there are more than 1 worker process
2015-01-23 00:09 <bry> so when a user gets transferred from one process to another, they lose session variables
2015-01-23 00:10 <bry> this is more than what I wanted to know about IIS
2015-01-23 00:10 <Toba> what is your session store
2015-01-23 00:10 <Toba> are you using RAM session store
2015-01-23 00:11 <Toba> you should be using a database or other session store...
2015-01-23 00:11 <bry> I don't know
2015-01-23 00:11 <Toba> is this .net or something else
2015-01-23 00:11 <bry> correct
2015-01-23 00:11 <loans> hah
2015-01-23 00:11 <Toba> ACTION jetpack.gif
2015-01-23 00:11 <Toba> asp?
2015-01-23 00:11 <Toba> you're using inproc mode, bry
2015-01-23 00:11 <Toba> https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178586%28v=vs.140%29.aspx
2015-01-23 00:12 <Toba> probably
2015-01-23 00:12 <bry> that is highly likely
2015-01-23 00:12 <Toba> imo, i would use SQLServer mode
2015-01-23 00:12 <Toba> it's the default
2015-01-23 00:12 <Toba> er, inproc is
2015-01-23 00:12 <bry> oh god dammit
2015-01-23 00:12 <bry> this was on my microsoft exam
2015-01-23 00:12 <Toba> sorry
2015-01-23 00:12 <bry> that I took like 3 years ago
2015-01-23 00:12 <Toba> that sucks ass
2015-01-23 00:12 <Toba> tbh, the default shouldn't be something shitty
2015-01-23 00:12 <Toba> the default should be to force you to actually configure something not shitty
2015-01-23 00:12 <Toba> fucking ms
2015-01-23 00:12 <bry> Agreed. Thank you.
2015-01-23 00:13 <bry> very much
2015-01-23 00:13 <Toba> also
2015-01-23 00:13 <Toba>  SQLServer mode stores session state in a SQL Server database. This ensures that session state is preserved if the Web application is restarted and also makes session state available to multiple Web servers in a Web farm.
2015-01-23 00:13 <Toba> careful with this
2015-01-23 00:13 <Toba> if you want deploys to flush session state
2015-01-23 00:13 <Toba> i would make the session variables prefixed with your software version
2015-01-23 00:13 <Toba> or something
2015-01-23 00:13 <Toba> otherwise, you'll end up with the same problem of what happens if you change database schema, but don't do a migration to update the existing data
2015-01-23 00:13 <Toba> ya dig?
2015-01-23 00:14 <Toba> FUCK

2015-01-23 00:18 <bry> this also explains why the problem is intermitten

2015-01-23 00:18 <bry> *replicate
2015-01-23 00:18 <bry> not solve
2015-01-23 00:18 <Toba> oh, you can

2015-01-23 00:18 <Toba> if it happens
2015-01-23 00:18 <Toba> then that's what is wrong

2015-01-23 00:18 <Toba> i don't know where the config is
2015-01-23 00:19 <Toba> but if you look in the config and it doesn't specify one
2015-01-23 00:19 <Toba> this is nearly certainly the issue
2015-01-23 00:20 <loans> holy shit i got xwing vs tie working

2015-01-23 00:20 <loans> aghagh
2015-01-23 00:20 <loans> also my entire thing is now 640x480
2015-01-23 00:20 <bry> the thing to specify where the session stuff is stored is not in my config

2015-01-23 16:11 <CarlFK> yes
2015-01-23 16:12 <t_j> ok, my approach would be to fsck the array in its current state
2015-01-23 16:12 <t_j> then insert the old disk back into the array and let it rebuild
2015-01-23 16:13 <CarlFK> when I said there is 1, I mean the other disk is gone. (it was taken to another location)
2015-01-23 16:13 <CarlFK> so now there is 1 disk, no array 
2015-01-23 16:13 <t_j> oh

2015-01-23 16:39 <loans> okay
2015-01-23 16:39 <loans> good

2015-01-23 16:40 <loans> NegativeK: are you just using rt reminders for this shit
2015-01-23 16:40 <NegativeK> loans: I slap a <date their membership will expire> on the end of the RT ticket title.
2015-01-23 16:40 <loans> and then just leave it open in member payments?
2015-01-23 16:40 <NegativeK> So it'd be "8ovation LLC canceled automatic payments to you - 2/21" and then leave it open.
2015-01-23 16:41 <NegativeK> Since I believe reminders only show for the person that made them, and bus count.
2015-01-23 16:41 <loans> yeah
2015-01-23 16:42 <NegativeK> That's something that would be a nice feature in the member's site -- discontinue membership and send leaving email on X date.
2015-01-23 16:43 <NegativeK> PayPal payers would get "Why don't you love us anymore?" and cash payers could get "Your cash payment expired, yo."

2015-01-23 16:45 <loans> there's a crop of expiries that need to be taken care of soonish
2015-01-23 16:45 <NegativeK> Not as a "This is a veep duty", but as a "It will need to be done, and I was doing a chunk of it."

2015-01-23 16:46 <NegativeK> Especially since quorum will be relevant during the member meeting.

2015-01-23 16:50 <skay> I subscribe to an rss feed of all our RTs, but I'm not sure how to enable email notifications for everything
2015-01-23 16:50 <loans> i wouldn't worry about email notifications personally - checking every couple of days is sufficient

2015-01-23 16:53 <loans> skay: do i need to make you a 'mean hat'
2015-01-23 16:53 <loans> that you can wear to be mean
2015-01-23 16:54 <skay> NegativeK: haha. last night I had a dream that a firing squad shot at me! but then I turned in to a zombie with freezing powers, so that was pretty cool
2015-01-23 16:54 <NegativeK> These powers are useful, but they make me soooo colllld.
2015-01-23 16:54 <skay> being able to point at things and cause them to freeze is my favorite power
2015-01-23 16:54 <NegativeK> skay: Firing people means setting their member status to discontinued and saying "Awww, why'd you leave us?" by clicking a send email button.
2015-01-23 16:54 <asl2> skay: does it work on helium-3?
2015-01-23 16:54 <skay> I was really annoyed that I hadn't perfected the ability to make things so cold that they were near absolute zero
2015-01-23 16:55 <NegativeK> Jesus.
2015-01-23 16:55 <NegativeK> skay's dislike of warm weather makes her want to freeze the world.
2015-01-23 16:55 <skay> I think you mean save the world
2015-01-23 16:56 <NegativeK> Well, nobody will die if they're all frozen to death already.
2015-01-23 16:56 <loans> also reducing spoilage
2015-01-23 16:56 <asl2> oh, He_4 also won't freeze
2015-01-23 16:56 <NegativeK> asl2: Even under pressure?
2015-01-23 16:56 <asl2> but just at 1 atm
2015-01-23 16:56 <skay> asl2: I didn't realize it wouldn't freeze!
2015-01-23 16:56 <greetermon> tells you right next to the wiki with an unmodified hosts file after dns finishes
2015-01-23 16:56 <asl2> I thought I remembered He_3 won't freeze at all but I could be wrong
2015-01-23 16:57 <NegativeK> skay: It also crawls out of containers.
2015-01-23 16:57 <CarlFK> skay wants to preserve the world for later.
2015-01-23 16:57 <asl2> skay: does your power only work by lowering temperature or can it work isothermically by increasing pressure?
2015-01-23 16:58 <skay> asl2: my dream self didn't know how it worked and realized that I needed practice to figure it out
2015-01-23 16:59 <skay> asl2: but didn't have time at the time since my dream self was fighting evil
2015-01-23 16:59 <asl2> usually my dreams are about not being able to figure out how to register for classes
2015-01-23 17:00 <skay> and at one point the bad guys came at me again with a scheme to be immune to my powers by having antifreeze blood or something, and I was wondering why my powers started to work on them, but then I figured maybe there was enough humidity in teh air to freeze in a shell around them?
2015-01-23 17:00 <skay> so then I started playing with making fog, because that was fun
2015-01-23 17:00 <skay> that was so illogical
2015-01-23 17:00 <skay> asl2: I hate those types of dreams
2015-01-23 17:01 <NegativeK> skay: Your dream sounds like an awesome superhero RPG.

2015-01-23 17:53 <NegativeK> Light on, govna.
2015-01-23 17:53 <`justin> now i'm imagining mitch altman flying down from the clouds
2015-01-23 17:53 <`justin> with a cape and everything
2015-01-23 17:53 <`justin> and then he lands in front of ps1
2015-01-23 17:53 <NegativeK> With a disappointed frown.
2015-01-23 17:53 <bry> with an aura
2015-01-23 17:53 <`justin> and just stand there and shakes his head
2015-01-23 17:53 <dodprocurement> Hi!  I just paid for a membership and want to know when i can drop by to repair my stealth bomber
2015-01-23 17:53 <`justin> then he flies away again
2015-01-23 17:54 <`justin> dodprocurement: we haven't got a lift of that, nor the space for it
2015-01-23 17:54 <`justin> but i hear the guys at SSHC are looking into getting one
2015-01-23 17:54 <`justin> s/of/for/
2015-01-23 17:54 <bry> what the hell is a stealth bomber
2015-01-23 17:54 <bry> don't wanna google that at work
2015-01-23 17:55 <`justin> bry: an airplane
2015-01-23 17:55 <bry> asl2: ass
2015-01-23 17:55 <bry> ha
2015-01-23 17:55 <`justin> that stealthily bombs things
2015-01-23 17:55 <NegativeK> That's hidden from radar.
2015-01-23 17:55 <asl2> informal name for the B-2
2015-01-23 17:55 <Toba> haha
2015-01-23 17:55 <asl2> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit
2015-01-23 17:55 <`justin> think black triangle thing
2015-01-23 17:55 <Toba> you didn't know what a stealth bomber is bry?
2015-01-23 17:55 <asl2> sure, in the visual range.  Nothing at all in radar.
2015-01-23 17:55 <Toba> you clearly don't obsess about following news about things that explode.
2015-01-23 17:55 <Toba> Pft.
2015-01-23 17:56 <bry> Toba: I know of the airplane jet thing, but I thought the person was being reasonable.
2015-01-23 17:56 <asl2> to be fair, the B-2 itself isn't supposed to explode.
2015-01-23 17:56 <Toba> it is asl2
2015-01-23 17:56 <asl2> just the stuff it drops
2015-01-23 17:56 <Toba> not possible
2015-01-23 17:56 <bry> I got that now
2015-01-23 17:56 <Toba> ha
2015-01-23 17:56 <bry> why I called them an ass
2015-01-23 17:56 <Toba> a stealth bomber would be a 32oz bottle of beer that can be successfully hidden on your person
2015-01-23 17:56 <Toba> I want to develop one
2015-01-23 17:56 <NegativeK> Toba: Not beer.
2015-01-23 17:57 <NegativeK> It should be spirits.
2015-01-23 17:57 <Toba> (bomber = large bottle of beer)
2015-01-23 17:57 <Toba> that's just a flask.
2015-01-23 17:57 <Toba> Pah.
2015-01-23 17:57 <NegativeK> Shut up. Plane name pun.
2015-01-23 17:57 <asl2> I'd settle for alcohol that was invisible to radar.
2015-01-23 17:57 <loans> NegativeK: i got your punn
2015-01-23 17:58 <asl2> wikipedia says reduced acoustic and IR and visual and radar signatures
2015-01-23 18:01 <NegativeK> Punununun.
2015-01-23 18:03 <Toba> drinking alochol increases my acoustic signature.

2015-01-23 18:04 <asl2> maybe ethanol - methanol tends to decrease it
2015-01-23 18:04 <bry> buahahahaha
2015-01-23 18:04 <NegativeK> Tableception.
2015-01-23 18:04 <Toba> ha
2015-01-23 18:04 <NegativeK> Flip the biggest table.
2015-01-23 18:04 <Toba> nice.
2015-01-23 18:05 <t_j> ok now I just need a 1099 and I can file my tax return
2015-01-23 18:07 <t_j> humm conference call with lawyer,  that sounds like not fun
2015-01-23 18:08 <loans> there is currently a search on for my (recently reclaimed) flash drive that had fixture test show files on it
2015-01-23 18:08 <loans> the time that has been spent wandering around looking for it could have easily rewritten at least one test program and left time to spare for the company to spend $5 on one it actually owns
2015-01-23 18:09 <loans> at this point i'm going to stay quiet just to see how this plays out

2015-01-23 18:16 <agocs> loans: legally speaking, the test fixtures might be your company's intellectual property

2015-01-23 18:19 <`justin> t_j: most employers don't have employment contracts in illinois
2015-01-23 18:19 <`justin> it's an 'at will' work state
2015-01-23 18:19 <loans> agocs: i signed nothing that says my output is the property of the company - further, fuck them
2015-01-23 18:20 <`justin> so they would have you sign a separate agreement
2015-01-23 18:20 <loans> it takes about 10 minutes to recreate a test show
2015-01-23 18:20 <`justin> regarding ownership of work
2015-01-23 18:20 <loans> gregg has pulled out another console and is going to write one for the fixtures he's testing now - quite a bit sooner than i expected the bullshit to end
2015-01-23 18:21 <agocs> loans: give gregg a high five for me
2015-01-23 18:21 <agocs> Let him know he's doing the right thing
2015-01-23 18:22 <loans> agocs: he's probably the one i hate the least on the shop floor
2015-01-23 18:22 <loans> talking to pete is exhausting because he gets intense about everything, nccc is a fuckwit
2015-01-23 18:22 <loans> so it's not really a HARD competition

2015-01-23 18:33 <NegativeK> Too Much Light is only two miles from my apartment.
2015-01-23 18:33 <`justin> so i was running this program from CMS that has a ridiculous amount of output to the terminal
2015-01-23 18:33 <`justin> and one of my coworkers saw (non-developer person)
2015-01-23 18:34 <`justin> and said she wanted to sit by me because whatever i do looks interesting and exciting
2015-01-23 18:34 <`justin> I'm like "uh..."
2015-01-23 18:34 <`justin> "it ain't that interesting..."
2015-01-23 18:35 <NegativeK> "That looks like hacking!"
2015-01-23 18:36 <asl2> is that IBM CMS?
2015-01-23 18:36 <agocs> `justin: Maybe she wants to sit by you for other reasons
2015-01-23 18:36 <NegativeK> An IBM CMS should be called ICBM.
2015-01-23 18:36 <NegativeK> Also, what agocs said.
2015-01-23 18:36 <agocs> ICBMS
2015-01-23 18:36 <agocs> IBS

2015-01-23 18:42 <agocs> kuroishi: Time to spin up a big-ass EC2 instance for Dockerbot?
2015-01-23 18:42 <NegativeK> Just take over all of AWS.
2015-01-23 18:42 <`justin> CEO is predicting that we'll be a $100M company by the end of 2015
2015-01-23 18:42 <`justin> and probably quarter billion by 2018
2015-01-23 18:43 <NegativeK> 250% growth in two years?
2015-01-23 18:43 <`justin> yup
2015-01-23 18:43 <NegativeK> Er, 150%. Whatever. Math.
2015-01-23 18:43 <`justin> yeah, whatever
2015-01-23 18:44 <kuroishi> I am predicting that I will be employed by a company of some worth by Q2
2015-01-23 18:44 <`justin> kuroishi: woot!
2015-01-23 18:44 <NegativeK> You send them dockerbot yet?
2015-01-23 18:44 <kuroishi> no but funny you should ask
2015-01-23 18:44 <`justin> kuroishi: you could start  your own $10 company
2015-01-23 18:44 <`justin> that will have some worth :-)
2015-01-23 18:45 <`justin> ($10)
2015-01-23 18:45 <NegativeK> Hey, the company could have negative worth.
2015-01-23 18:45 <`justin> good point
2015-01-23 18:45 <`justin> kuroishi: start a company that bleeds money
2015-01-23 18:46 <NegativeK> Then put a bucket under the company to collect your salary.

2015-01-23 18:48 <NegativeK> Man, I didn't get any machining done yesterday.
2015-01-23 18:48 <`justin> it's entirely plausible that you downloaded like
2015-01-23 18:48 <`justin> 1 or 2 bytes that fast
2015-01-23 18:48 <NegativeK> Just my awesomesauce robot.
2015-01-23 18:49 <`justin> NegativeK: it was pretty awesomesauce
2015-01-23 18:49 <`justin> don't feel bad about machining
2015-01-23 18:49 <NegativeK> I kinda wanted to bust out the rotary table.
2015-01-23 18:49 <`justin> you accomplished more yesterday than you have in the entire past year :-)
2015-01-23 18:49 <NegativeK> But I knew it'd take long enough that I wouldn't get home at a reasonable time.
2015-01-23 18:49 <kuroishi> I don't think it's plausable that I got 1 or two bites in 200,000 GB/s
2015-01-23 18:49 <NegativeK> Lies!
2015-01-23 18:49 <NegativeK> I made t-nuts before the robot.

2015-01-23 18:50 <NegativeK> My favorite part about my robot is how all the parts will go back where they came from when I'm done.
2015-01-23 18:50 <kuroishi> anyway, no, it's not time to put dockerbot on AWS, it's time to deploy it to dust sucking heat spitting station one.
2015-01-23 18:51 <NegativeK> kuroishi: Dust Collector?
2015-01-23 18:51 <kuroishi> yeah, the one we have in the catwalk
2015-01-23 18:51 <agocs> Hot dust collector
2015-01-23 18:51 <NegativeK> Should've gotten Dean to work with that instead of a new system.
2015-01-23 18:52 <kuroishi> hahaha
2015-01-23 18:52 <NegativeK> Fan, cyclone, filter stack, output of which goes to the rack.
2015-01-23 18:52 <NegativeK> Move the rack next to the dust collector.
2015-01-23 18:52 <kuroishi> it would be a marginal improvement
2015-01-23 19:02 <kuroishi> The same idiot in dallas who has his lawyer sending me details of his property purchase also linked david.koppel@gmail.com to his mastercard.  Thanks douche.
2015-01-23 19:03 <kuroishi> is it identity theft if someones identity is thrust upon you?
2015-01-23 19:04 <kuroishi> I hope your Every event will be vanilla, a safe space for people to come and build something cool and leave having made new friends and a cool project.

2015-01-23 20:32 <loans> okay
2015-01-23 20:32 <loans> so this fog machine uses a discrete thermostat thing
2015-01-23 20:33 <loans> which appears to be the problem
2015-01-23 20:33 <loans> it's got a prope (thermocouple maybe) that goes into the block
2015-01-23 20:33 <loans> and a test button
2015-01-23 20:33 <loans> if you hit the test button, the thing heats
2015-01-23 20:33 <loans> so all the temperature regulation is happening at that thermostat - no digital temp control at all
2015-01-23 20:33 <loans> which is fine i guess

2015-01-23 21:39 <NegativeK> Still remember them, because om nom.
2015-01-23 21:39 <bjonnh> hey hush puppies looks good
2015-01-23 21:39 <NegativeK> bjonnh: Of course they do; it's fried cornmeal. ;)
2015-01-23 21:39 <jackhholmes>  Just had to convince my mom to make an Xfinity online account.
2015-01-23 21:39 <jackhholmes> god damn that was annoying...
2015-01-23 21:40 <bjonnh> ACTION puts some jalapeno in NegativeK eyewash
2015-01-23 21:40 <NegativeK> Can old people reading glasses be contacts?
2015-01-23 21:40 <NegativeK> 'Cause that might be the only way I have eyewash. >.>
2015-01-23 21:43 <kuroishi> Snappys shrimp by ravenswood and irving park has some top notch hush puppies
2015-01-23 21:43 <kuroishi> not jalapeno
2015-01-23 21:43 <kuroishi> but delicious garlic butter to put on them
2015-01-23 21:43 <NegativeK> Hmmmmmm. Want.
2015-01-23 21:43 <kuroishi> also amazing fried everything.
2015-01-23 21:43 <bjonnh> shit I just got a nice idea to make an optical reverb
2015-01-23 21:43 <kuroishi> fish, shrimp, chicken, etc
2015-01-23 21:43 <bjonnh> someone give me some uv leds
2015-01-23 21:44 <kuroishi> NegativeK: it's right off the irving brown line, hit it up sometime
2015-01-23 21:44 <NegativeK> Yeah; just saw that.
2015-01-23 21:44 <NegativeK> I'll have to lunch there at some point.
2015-01-23 21:45 <agocs> okay, I got board approval to turn SSHC into a firearms manufacturer
2015-01-23 21:45 <agocs> woo
2015-01-23 21:45 <agocs> "board approval"
2015-01-23 21:45 <kuroishi> nice.
2015-01-23 21:45 <`justin> well
2015-01-23 21:45 <`justin> we're done retreating
2015-01-23 21:45 <agocs> Two of us agreed
2015-01-23 21:45 <asl21> I was an international arms merchant for a while in the 90s
2015-01-23 21:45 <`justin> now i need to take a nap
2015-01-23 21:46 <NegativeK> I'd love to myself a prosthetic arm.
2015-01-23 21:46 <agocs> NegativeK: Prosthetic firearm?
2015-01-23 21:46 <NegativeK> Then carry it somewhere. So I can claim to be an arms trafficer.
2015-01-23 21:46 <agocs> asl21: In what way?
2015-01-23 21:46 <kuroishi> agocs: were both of them you?
2015-01-23 21:46 <asl21> I worked on some crypto code and got approval under ITAR to ship it
2015-01-23 21:46 <`justin> NegativeK: why does it need to be prosthetic?
2015-01-23 21:46 <agocs> kuroishi: No, our president agreed provided that we can also make jewelry and "cute little magazines for the bullets to go in"
2015-01-23 21:46 <`justin> i traffic real arms every day
2015-01-23 21:46 <NegativeK> `justin: Less mess.
2015-01-23 21:47 <kuroishi> cute magazines.  Check.
2015-01-23 21:47 <NegativeK> ACTION waves his arms in traffic.
2015-01-23 21:47 <NegativeK> asl21: You gave in to the man, man.
2015-01-23 21:47 <NegativeK> I wonder how the Android and iOS stores deal with cryptography and overseas markets.
2015-01-23 21:47 <`justin> agocs: ah, this way we can shoot people with diamond earings :-D
2015-01-23 21:47 <NegativeK> Do you have to declare crypto when you submit so they can exclude it from the Forbidden Zones?
2015-01-23 21:48 <asl21> laws have changed
2015-01-23 21:48 <agocs> `justin: Incendiary, armor piercing earrings
2015-01-23 21:48 <kuroishi> I read that as shoot people wearing diamond earrings
2015-01-23 21:48 <NegativeK> asl2: I think there're just restrictions on Iran and North Korea and the like?
2015-01-23 21:48 <asl2> but I think you may still not be allowed to export android or iOS phones to NK
2015-01-23 21:48 <NegativeK> Ahhh.
2015-01-23 21:49 <asl2> you probably also aren't allowed to import them either, but that would be NK law
2015-01-23 21:49 <NegativeK> I suspect I violate North Korean law frequently.
2015-01-23 21:49 <kuroishi> I wonder if theres any hackerspaces in North Korea =P
2015-01-23 21:49 <`justin> kuroishi: they will be wearing them after we shoot them :-)
2015-01-23 21:50 <agocs> kuroishi: http://status.pyongyanghackerspace.org/
2015-01-23 21:50 <NegativeK> Depleted uranium lobe plugs.
2015-01-23 21:50 <NegativeK> The only reason I'd ever get my ears pierced is to stretch them for jade plugs.

2015-01-23 21:51 <bjonnh> NegativeK: you mean jalapeno plugs?
2015-01-23 21:51 <NegativeK> Ghost pepper plugs.
2015-01-23 21:52 <kuroishi> NegativeK: gauge your septum out so you can put a syringe through it like all the cool kids
2015-01-23 21:52 <bjonnh> Toba: that's a scam
2015-01-23 21:52 <NegativeK> Nooooope.
2015-01-23 21:52 <NegativeK> I was at 12 gauge before I took it out for a week.
2015-01-23 21:52 <kuroishi> or a ghost pepper.. in your septum.
2015-01-23 21:52 <NegativeK> That's like blood donation syringe.
2015-01-23 21:52 <loans> no peppers in septums in the space
2015-01-23 21:52 <loans> i've decided
2015-01-23 21:52 <bjonnh> NegativeK: bulk capsaicin 
2015-01-23 21:52 <loans> that's against the rules
2015-01-23 21:53 <NegativeK> Capsaicin nasal spray.
2015-01-23 21:53 <kuroishi> loans: fascist.
2015-01-23 21:53 <kuroishi> respect my pepper oriface freedumbs.
2015-01-23 21:53 <Toba> bjonnh: hwy do you think i posted it with allcaps
2015-01-23 21:53 <agocs> ghost peppers in your scrotum
2015-01-23 21:53 <bjonnh> now that bry is not in charge anymore, NegativeK will be able to do its own tatoo on the laser cutter
2015-01-23 21:53 <kuroishi> woooo
2015-01-23 21:53 <bjonnh> Toba: because 
2015-01-23 21:54 <NegativeK> Holy fuck. https://www.kolopiercing.com/green-nephrite-jade-pinchers-p-1312.html
2015-01-23 21:54 <bjonnh> hmmm capsaicin is volatile
2015-01-23 21:54 <bjonnh> needs around 200Â°
2015-01-23 21:54 <bjonnh> C
2015-01-23 21:54 <NegativeK> I felt like my retainer was bumping up against the cartlidge in my nose a bit much, though. 6 gauge might be really unpleasant. =(
2015-01-23 21:55 <kuroishi> punching a hole in your septum in the first place sounds unpleasant.
2015-01-23 21:55 <bjonnh> Â« Capsaicin is a banned substance in equestrian sports because of its hypersensitizing and pain-relieving properties.  Â»
2015-01-23 21:55 <loans> those things sound at odds
2015-01-23 21:55 <bjonnh> Â« Capsaicin is used as an analgesic in topical ointments, nasal sprays (Sinol-M), and dermal patches to relieve pain Â»
2015-01-23 21:56 <bjonnh> kuroishi: nasal sprays :p
2015-01-23 21:56 <kuroishi> ouch
2015-01-23 21:56 <NegativeK> kuroishi: Hurt less than venipuncture for blood donation.
2015-01-23 21:56 <kuroishi> ACTION does a line of capsaicin
2015-01-23 21:56 <bjonnh> ouch
2015-01-23 21:56 <NegativeK> ACTION was expecting way more pain that "that's it?"
2015-01-23 21:56 <`justin> kuroishi's nose falls off
2015-01-23 21:56 <NegativeK> kuroishi's nose punches him in the eyes.
2015-01-23 21:57 <bjonnh> well ghost pepper is just 1/16 of pure capsaicin
2015-01-23 21:57 <NegativeK> s/that/than/
2015-01-23 21:57 <kuroishi> ACTION pours blood out of his eyes
2015-01-23 21:57 <`justin> i'm pretty sure i've heard about people trying to snort ground up peppers before (so not even pure capsaicin)
2015-01-23 21:57 <`justin> and they just instantly started bleeding
2015-01-23 21:57 <NegativeK> Impressive.
2015-01-23 21:57 <`justin> and wouldn't stop
2015-01-23 21:57 <bjonnh> `justin: people snort all kind of dumb stuff
2015-01-23 21:57 <kuroishi> hah
2015-01-23 21:57 <`justin> without going to the hospital
2015-01-23 21:58 <NegativeK> Nose goes "FUCK YOU, ASSHOLE. I'LL TEACH YOU TO NOT DO THAT SHIT"
2015-01-23 21:58 <kuroishi> they snort wasabi in that jackass movie.
2015-01-23 21:58 <kuroishi> that didn't look fun
2015-01-23 21:58 <`justin> *shudder*

2015-01-23 21:58 <asl2> I know someone who claimed to have snorted powdered non-dairy creamer
2015-01-23 21:58 <NegativeK> ...

2015-01-23 21:58 <bjonnh> well one stupid thing is to snort aspirin
2015-01-23 21:59 <asl2> it is apparently the kind of thing one does at most once
2015-01-23 21:59 <bjonnh> because blood-thinner
2015-01-23 21:59 <kuroishi> like drinking listerine.
2015-01-23 21:59 <bjonnh> snorting asbestos
2015-01-23 21:59 <NegativeK> asl2: Seems like it'd be really messy
2015-01-23 21:59 <NegativeK> Snorting 10 kg of plutonium.
2015-01-23 21:59 <`justin> apparently sll the cheep wasabi is actually just horseradish
2015-01-23 21:59 <`justin> real wasabi, so i've been told, is actually fairly rare
2015-01-23 21:59 <kuroishi> green horseradish
2015-01-23 21:59 <bjonnh> NegativeK: I think you stop after the first milligrams
2015-01-23 22:00 <kuroishi> you still probably don't want to snort horseradish either.
2015-01-23 22:00 <bjonnh> Fluorine
2015-01-23 22:00 <`justin> no, no you don't
2015-01-23 22:01 <`justin> but, i suppose no one here has ever had real wasabi without knowing it
2015-01-23 22:01 <`justin> i mean
2015-01-23 22:01 <kuroishi> who has a good recipe for slow cooker chili?
2015-01-23 22:01 <`justin> that's not the kind of thing you just give to people in your restaurant without telling them
2015-01-23 22:01 <bjonnh> kuroishi: cook it with tar
2015-01-23 22:01 <kuroishi> mmm tar
2015-01-23 22:01 <`justin> kuroishi: beef, black beans, tomatoes, onions, and a shit ton of chili powder
2015-01-23 22:01 <kuroishi> that is a good recipe, thanks for your input bjonnh.
2015-01-23 22:01 <`justin> oh, and beef stock, i guess
2015-01-23 22:01 <bjonnh> it's a tradition in some places in europe, they cook meat inside many layers of aluminium foil by throwing it in tar after finishing the roads
2015-01-23 22:02 <bjonnh> and lets cook that for hours
2015-01-23 22:02 <`justin> maybe some other shit too if you feel like it
2015-01-23 22:02 <`justin> bjonnh: that sounds cancerous
2015-01-23 22:02 <kuroishi> that's why the pilgrims left europe.
2015-01-23 22:02 <bjonnh> `justin: not if it is well closed (which I doubt)

2015-01-23 22:04 <kuroishi> WAT
2015-01-23 22:05 <agocs> kuroishi: I imagine it's kind of like frying
2015-01-23 22:06 <agocs> I'd try it
2015-01-23 22:07 <NegativeK> I'd only try it if someone buried the meat in the freshly paved road and then shoveled it out after the required cooking time.
2015-01-23 22:07 <kuroishi> I want to throw meat in tar.
2015-01-23 22:07 <asl2> tar cvf - meat
2015-01-23 22:08 <NegativeK> Let's inject tar into meat.
2015-01-23 22:08 <kuroishi> we need a tar bath in the kitchen
2015-01-23 22:08 <NegativeK> Cook it from the inside out like people think how microwaves work.

2015-01-23 22:25 <bjonnh> how does wall work?
2015-01-23 22:29 <bjonnh> NegativeK: what do you have in these terminals?
2015-01-23 22:30 <NegativeK> One has six windows for websocket testing shit.
2015-01-23 22:31 <NegativeK> So source files, windows to run shit in, et cetera. Another is where I go to update staging/prod/dev/whatever.
2015-01-23 22:31 <bjonnh> you don't like tmux (or screen)
2015-01-23 22:31 <NegativeK> Another has test cases and generic system bullshit like alsamixer.

2015-01-23 22:33 <NegativeK> So much shit.
2015-01-23 22:42 <hef__> NegativeK: websockets?
2015-01-23 22:42 <hef__> what are you doing?
2015-01-23 22:42 <NegativeK> hef__: Our mobile app talks in websockets.
2015-01-23 22:42 <hef__> Interesting
2015-01-23 22:42 <NegativeK> So I wrote a test client using the Tornado websocket client crap to do the talkin'.
2015-01-23 22:42 <NegativeK> Summary: not hard.
2015-01-23 22:43 <hef__> that's kind of funny
2015-01-23 22:43 <hef__> I was finding websockets kind of intimidating
2015-01-23 22:43 <NegativeK> It kind of sounded like that when you mentioned it yesterday/whenever.
2015-01-23 22:43 <NegativeK> I expect you'll breeze through it.
2015-01-23 22:43 <hef__> although it may be starting on javascript that I find intimidating
2015-01-23 22:44 <NegativeK> Run JSLint and you won't trick yourself as much. Though, you'll get pissed at JSLint.
2015-01-23 22:44 <hef__> hah
2015-01-23 22:44 <bjonnh> NegativeK: 300s of websockets?
2015-01-23 22:45 <bjonnh> I'd like to have an overview of that
2015-01-23 22:45 <NegativeK> Uh.
2015-01-23 22:45 <NegativeK> Hmm.
2015-01-23 22:45 <NegativeK> I get tripped up in futures for Tornado more than I do for websockets.
2015-01-23 22:45 <NegativeK> Websockets are "open", "write", and "read".
2015-01-23 22:45 <loans> setting up a manufacturer repair. mfg is shipping a loaner console directly to customer, who will use that box to send their console back
2015-01-23 22:45 <NegativeK> Like, that's it.
2015-01-23 22:45 <loans> i never have to touch it and i get to mark up the mfg repair costs
2015-01-23 22:45 <NegativeK> You send and receive whole messages. The libraries handle the buffering and shit.
2015-01-23 22:46 <bjonnh> oh you have shit in that too
2015-01-23 22:47 <NegativeK> You can't tell me what I've shit in.

2015-01-23 23:11 <bjonnh> oh ok
2015-01-23 23:12 <loans> $350 doesn't buy you much in a laptop, last time i looked
2015-01-23 23:12 <NegativeK> It'd get a web browser.

2015-01-23 23:55 <loans> agocs: cool, i'm gonna drink beer and play with html/js
2015-01-23 23:55 <loans> i think
2015-01-23 23:55 <agocs> I'll plan to be at ps1 tomorrow; we can hook up there/then
2015-01-23 23:55 <loans> to try and make a thing that does a thing?
2015-01-23 23:55 <agocs> Cool
2015-01-23 23:57 <agocs> Basically the js just needs to query for the current thing to display, tell another iframe to load that display if it's changed, and wait for some time (1s? 30s? The world is our oyster)
2015-01-23 23:57 <loans> yeah
2015-01-23 23:57 <loans> so utlimately its two iframes? one with the js and one that's modified by the js?
2015-01-23 23:57 <loans> i'm only vaguely aware of what an iframe is
2015-01-23 23:57 <hef__> I imagine the js one would be outside the iframe
2015-01-23 23:58 <loans> so in the page proper
2015-01-23 23:58 <loans> ?
2015-01-23 23:58 <hef__> probably

2015-01-23 23:58 <agocs> okay

2015-01-23 23:59 <hef__> NegativeK: I did not know that
2015-01-23 23:59 <hef__> can it refresh an iframe?
2015-01-23 23:59 <NegativeK> Parent can't affect child and vis-a-versa. It's so you can't load my Gmail and fuck wit shit.
2015-01-23 23:59 <NegativeK> Oh, do believe yes to refresh.
2015-01-23 23:59 <agocs> NegativeK: Can js in one iframe modify the contents of another iframe?
2015-01-24 00:00 <NegativeK> agocs: I very much think that's a big security nono.
2015-01-24 00:00 <agocs> Like, not modify the contents
2015-01-24 00:00 <NegativeK> Uh.
2015-01-24 00:00 <loans> load a different page
2015-01-24 00:00 <agocs> but be like "hey you iframe, you load foo.bar/baz now"
2015-01-24 00:00 <NegativeK> Change page source, yes.
2015-01-24 00:00 <loans> that's what we want 
2015-01-24 00:00 <NegativeK> That's an attribute on the iframe tag.
2015-01-24 00:00 <NegativeK> Done. That was easy!

2015-01-24 02:58 <jackhholmes> hello
2015-01-24 02:58 <jackhholmes> I'm on irc during class thanks to my server and the college having putty installed
2015-01-24 02:59 <loans> pay attention to your lessons
2015-01-24 02:59 <loans> yo
2015-01-24 02:59 <jackhholmes> He's teaching about basic arithmatic atm
2015-01-24 03:00 <loans> why are you in that class, then
2015-01-24 03:00 <jackhholmes> Because its a required class and it happens to be the first day.
2015-01-24 03:00 <loans> what class is it?
2015-01-24 03:00 <jackhholmes> After a few weeks it should get a little harder
2015-01-24 03:01 <jackhholmes> Applied Mathematics
2015-01-24 03:01 <jackhholmes> * I
2015-01-24 03:01 <loans> that sounds like something that's testoutable
2015-01-24 03:01 <jackhholmes> Maybe, but I'm don't think I'm good enough at math to test out.
2015-01-24 03:02 <loans> if he's talking about arithmetic, that sounds like the "Here's your high school algebra class again" class
2015-01-24 03:02 <Toba> ry focusing on the class less, that might help
2015-01-24 03:02 <jackhholmes> Pretty much...
2015-01-24 03:03 <loans> when I switched to my theatre major, i had already tested out of the math requirements
2015-01-24 03:03 <Toba> that's annoying.
2015-01-24 03:03 <Toba> I had one in college that covered algebra over again in like the first 3 weeks.
2015-01-24 03:03 <jackhholmes> Toba: yup
2015-01-24 03:03 <Toba> annoying.
2015-01-24 03:03 <jackhholmes> Toba: I'm assuming that's how this one will be
2015-01-24 03:03 <Toba> like... that should already be known.
2015-01-24 03:03 <Toba> haha, let's hope it doesn't do that the entire class.
2015-01-24 03:03 <loans> jackhholmes: you can alwys try taking the placement tests, if your school has 'em
2015-01-24 03:03 <loans> worst case is you waste an hour or two
2015-01-24 03:03 <loans> best case - you skip a couple of stupid classes
2015-01-24 03:04 <jackhholmes> Agreed with both points
2015-01-24 03:04 <loans> http://pastebin.com/FPkBUsbv
2015-01-24 03:04 <loans> what the fuuuuck
2015-01-24 03:05 <jackhholmes> Well, I took a math placement before and skipped all the under 100 level classes, but didn't get past I think 110
2015-01-24 03:05 <loans> i don't miss the general ed shit in college
2015-01-24 03:06 <jackhholmes> loans: What company is that?
2015-01-24 03:07 <jackhholmes> FYI, this is MAT 114
2015-01-24 03:07 <loans> paypal, who the fuck do you think
2015-01-24 03:07 <`justin> loans: big paypal brother is watching you
2015-01-24 03:08 <jackhholmes> loans: Yeah, fuck paypal...
2015-01-24 03:09 <jackhholmes> Can't wait to use braintree
2015-01-24 03:11 <loans> you know braintree is owned by paypal, right
2015-01-24 03:11 <Toba> haha
2015-01-24 03:12 <Toba> I think braintree's policies are different though
2015-01-24 03:12 <Toba> w/r/t not seizing your money like shitfucks
2015-01-24 03:12 <Toba> not that i've read them
2015-01-24 03:12 <Toba> but paypal gets away with that shit becuase they deal primarily with very small players
2015-01-24 03:12 <Toba> and consumers
2015-01-24 03:15 <loans> paypal gets away with shit because they aren't a bank
2015-01-24 03:15 <loans> and so they're not regulated like a bank
2015-01-24 03:17 <loans> jesus fuck i hate paypal
2015-01-24 03:23 <jackhholmes> loans: I didn't know that, fuck
2015-01-24 03:29 <Toba> i just used the odb II reader in a truckstop in wisconsin to figure out of the car is fucked
2015-01-24 03:29 <Toba> it's not

2015-01-24 16:08 <hef__> you should be good to go on the laser

2015-01-27 07:04 <DoormanDave> Hello World!
2015-01-27 07:04 <DoormanDave> woo! It's good to have a subnet to call home.administrhater.net again.
2015-01-27 07:05 <DoormanDave> ACTION is finally online from the comfort of his desktop
2015-01-27 07:05 <tac_> hi DoormanDave 
2015-01-27 07:05 <tac_> are you the real DoormanDave? Or the bot that does the doorbell?
2015-01-27 07:06 <DoormanDave> I'm the real DoormanDave, also known as kuroishi
2015-01-27 07:06 <tac_> So... not the bot?
2015-01-27 07:06 <DoormanDave> the doorbot is doormon/zirc
2015-01-27 07:06 <tac_> I don't see why you can't be an extension of that bot
2015-01-27 07:06 <DoormanDave> I'm a cleverly disguised bot that only shows up on IRC at 1 AM rambling after the real Doorman Dave has been drinking.
2015-01-27 07:07 <tac_> I mean all that lisp maintenance must have left you but a husk of a man, right?
2015-01-27 07:07 <tac_> heh
2015-01-27 07:07 <DoormanDave> yeah
2015-01-27 07:07 <tac_> Man a drink would be nice right about now
2015-01-27 07:07 <DoormanDave> templating in lisp is no feat for mere mortals.';
2015-01-27 07:07 <DoormanDave> there's still plenty of light beer at the space!
2015-01-27 07:08 <tac_> I am better off passing out without the hangover tomorrow though ;(
2015-01-27 07:08 <tac_> and soon, rather than after a drive to the space
2015-01-27 07:08 <tac_> (and back)
2015-01-27 07:08 <DoormanDave> ACTION can just stumble there and back, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing anymore.
2015-01-27 07:11 <DoormanDave> no more terminal lag =D
2015-01-27 07:11 <DoormanDave> well i'm maxing out my wifi on a speed test, that's a good sign.
2015-01-27 07:12 <tac_> oh?
2015-01-27 07:12 <tac_> Do you live near the space?
2015-01-27 07:12 <tac_> Within drinking distance, at least?
2015-01-27 07:12 <DoormanDave> I live a block from the space.
2015-01-27 07:12 <tac_> oh man
2015-01-27 07:13 <tac_> I know where I'm going to get black out drunk next weekend
2015-01-27 07:13 <DoormanDave> hah
2015-01-27 07:13 <tac_> well the drunk part will happen at PS1
2015-01-27 07:13 <tac_> the blackout part at dave's house!
2015-01-27 07:13 <DoormanDave> feel free to come by for a drink, I'm usually bored after my kids go to bed =P
2015-01-27 07:14 <DoormanDave> you can give them hungover math lessons to warm up for sunday.
2015-01-27 07:14 <tac_> lol
2015-01-27 07:14 <tac_> yes
2015-01-27 07:14 <DoormanDave> Have you ever taught calculus to a 4 year old?
2015-01-27 07:14 <tac_> I could try
2015-01-27 07:14 <tac_> How are your 4-y-os' algebra?
2015-01-27 07:15 <DoormanDave> probably better than mine.
2015-01-27 07:15 <tac_> nice
2015-01-27 07:15 <DoormanDave> I've seen her solving quadradic equations.
2015-01-27 07:16 <tac_> nice
2015-01-27 07:17 <tac_> Oh, fun fact I learned today, DoormanDave 
2015-01-27 07:17 <DoormanDave> wtf, I can't google.
2015-01-27 07:17 <greetermon> figure it oui
2015-01-27 07:17 <tac_> you know the mod operation, right?
2015-01-27 07:18 <DoormanDave> yeah, pre punk operation.
2015-01-27 07:18 <tac_> !python map(lambda x: x % 3, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
2015-01-27 07:18 <sudlowbot>  [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1]
2015-01-27 07:18 <tac_> mod 3, there are only three numbers: 0, 1, and 2
2015-01-27 07:18 <tac_> but watch this
2015-01-27 07:18 <tac_> !python map(lambda x: x*x % 3, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
2015-01-27 07:18 <sudlowbot>  [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
2015-01-27 07:18 <tac_> looking at x^2 mod 3
2015-01-27 07:18 <tac_> there are only 2 possibilities: 0 and 1
2015-01-27 07:18 <DoormanDave> hm
2015-01-27 07:19 <tac_> weird consequence of this
2015-01-27 07:20 <tac_> draw a grid 
2015-01-27 07:20 <tac_> pick any point which lies on the grid lines
2015-01-27 07:20 <DoormanDave> this hurts my head, not gonna lie.
2015-01-27 07:20 <DoormanDave> hang on
2015-01-27 07:20 <DoormanDave> ACTION gets grid paper
2015-01-27 07:20 <tac_> heh
2015-01-27 07:21 <tac_> maaaybe not the best drinking subject, math is
2015-01-27 07:21 <DoormanDave> point. got it.
2015-01-27 07:21 <tac_> heh ok
2015-01-27 07:21 <DoormanDave> I'm only ever interested in it when slightly tipsy
2015-01-27 07:21 <tac_> You can pick a point 3,4 on the grid
2015-01-27 07:21 <tac_> (3,4)
2015-01-27 07:21 <tac_> and the distance from that point to the point (0, 0) is exactly 5
2015-01-27 07:22 <DoormanDave> right, I'm a table top gamer, I didn't need graph paper to tell you that
2015-01-27 07:22 <tac_> or you can pick the point (5, 12) which is exactly a distance of 13 from (0,0)
2015-01-27 07:23 <DoormanDave> k
2015-01-27 07:23 <tac_> in the case of (3,4), one of the coordinates (namely, the 3) is a multiple of 3, and in the other case, (5, 12) one of the coordinates (this time, 12) is a multiple of 3
2015-01-27 07:24 <tac_> It turns out that *any* point with integer coordinates which lies an integer distance from (0,0) always has at least one of its coordinates as a multiple of 3
2015-01-27 07:24 <tac_> tripy, spooky numbers
2015-01-27 07:24 <DoormanDave> that's interesting.
2015-01-27 07:25 <DoormanDave> that relates to your modulus function?
2015-01-27 07:25 <tac_> and it has to do with the fact that x^2 is always either 0 or 1 mod 3
2015-01-27 07:25 <tac_> because being 0 mod 3 is hte same as "is a multiple of 3"
2015-01-27 07:25 <tac_> !python map(lambda x: x%3, [0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15])
2015-01-27 07:25 <sudlowbot>  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
2015-01-27 07:25 <tac_> see
2015-01-27 07:26 <DoormanDave> interesting

2015-01-27 15:16 <Toba__> but I haven't even got to the point of downloading the programmer utility yet, and I don't have a 3.3v serial accessory to do the burning with

2015-01-27 16:09 <bjonnh> I checked permissions, they are the same
2015-01-27 16:16 <agocs> Do both users have that public key in their ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file?
2015-01-27 16:17 <NegativeK> I can't help but criticize people whose multi-page resume has a paragraph that rolls over just one line to the next page.

2015-01-27 16:21 <Toba__> NegativeK: I have the toolchain mostly set up, and I think I'll be able to burn code tonight if I drop by microcenter on the way to ps1 and get a uart cable

2015-01-27 16:36 <bjonnh> DoormanDave: so I should better start from scratch
2015-01-27 16:36 <`justin> loans: yep, and then you fix it ;-)
2015-01-27 16:37 <DoormanDave> I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to use it, but I would recommend learning it rather than disabling it on say a RHEL server
2015-01-27 16:37 <`justin> soon there will be no one to fix his fuck ups
2015-01-27 16:39 <bjonnh> DoormanDave: No I will not disable it, because it looks cool. The only thing I'm worried is to switch an ARCH install to selinux as from what I read, it is easy to screw up
2015-01-27 16:40 <loans> `justin: i actually don't fix shit

2015-01-27 16:53 <bjonnh> DoormanDave: I can handle XML
2015-01-27 16:53 <DoormanDave> it's subject to change, likely soon.
2015-01-27 16:53 <DoormanDave> I wouldn't spend too much time on it =P
2015-01-27 16:53 <bjonnh> shit
2015-01-27 16:54 <bjonnh> ok lets keep that for later then
2015-01-27 16:54 <DoormanDave> speaking of which imcleod and hef- and anyone else interested should get together to chat about server hardware
2015-01-27 16:54 <imcleod> DoormanDave: I'd love to, but I'm about to skip town for 12 days.
2015-01-27 16:54 <DoormanDave> bjonnh: having a map and plan for when we do redo things would be good
2015-01-27 16:54 <DoormanDave> nooooo
2015-01-27 16:54 <bjonnh> DoormanDave: that's why I wanted to do that
2015-01-27 16:55 <DoormanDave> iaaaaaan!
2015-01-27 16:55 <bry> just scared the crap out of myself
2015-01-27 16:55 <bjonnh> DoormanDave: next step will be to make the svg kind of active. So you can see what is down or not
2015-01-27 16:55 <imcleod> Please.  I'm merely a hardware pusher.  You and hef are the real management talent for the space IT infrastructure.

2015-01-27 16:55 <bjonnh> DoormanDave: then we will be able to have a "center of operations" with huge screens and maps and stuff
2015-01-27 16:55 <DoormanDave> imcleod: maybe we'll have a toy ovirt setup when you get back =P

2015-01-28 14:59 <loans> man, they take a harder stance on random visitors than us
2015-01-28 14:59 <loans> Other than during events open to the public, Double Union visitors must be the invited guest of a member. Please do not visit without the express invitation of a member
2015-01-28 15:00 <sylphiae> they try to be the anti-noisebridge i suppose
2015-01-28 15:01 <loans> nothing wrong with that
2015-01-28 15:04 <loans> they vote on every new member
2015-01-28 15:05 <`Nerobro> how long have htey been around?
2015-01-28 15:05 <loans> dunno
2015-01-28 15:05 <`Nerobro> And I wonder how they'd react to a hackerspace with a cock-n-balls as their logo.
2015-01-28 15:06 <Bioguy> They vote on every new member?  That sounds like a fraternity to me.
2015-01-28 15:07 <`justin> loans: sounds kind of like nyc resistor
2015-01-28 15:07 <`justin> i think
2015-01-28 15:07 <loans> `justin: very similar
2015-01-28 15:08 <`justin> i have a hard time imagining how those communities actually work
2015-01-28 15:08 <`justin> granted i haven't visited a space like that
2015-01-28 15:09 <loans> i dunno - the insularity would bother me a lot
2015-01-28 15:09 <Bioguy> `justin: I think the idea is, you can't just visit, you need to be invited to visit. ;)
2015-01-28 15:09 <`justin> what loans said
2015-01-28 15:09 <`justin> insularity
2015-01-28 15:09 <`Nerobro> NYC Resistor doesn't trigger any 'well that's ugly" feelings.
2015-01-28 15:10 <`justin> and it feels kind of elitist
2015-01-28 15:10 <`justin> but on the other hand, i can see why you might want to do that
2015-01-28 15:10 <KyleB> If I'm seeing the right Double Union, it's also female-only. So, single sex, votes on each member, not open to visitors without an invite. Sounds like the definition of a fraternity. Which is fine, I happen to be rather fond of fraternities.
2015-01-28 15:10 <`justin> try to prevent problem people from joining your org by not letting them in in the first place
2015-01-28 15:11 <sylphiae> double union has a specific purpose, so if you're automatically comparing it to ps1 in your mind they do seem much more restrictive
2015-01-28 15:11 <Bioguy> I don't think it's elitist per se... I think that they are focused on security and making a safe place.  Scanning their blog indicates they have a director level position called "Chief Security Officer.
2015-01-28 15:11 <sylphiae> right
2015-01-28 15:12 <loans> i'm not trying to suggest there's anything wrong with how they're doing stuff - they're definitey a way different kind of space
2015-01-28 15:12 <Bioguy> KyleB: I was in a fraternity too, so I understand
2015-01-28 15:12 <Bioguy> loans: I think we all agree.  Spaces are going to exist in response to a need.
2015-01-28 15:13 <Bioguy> I also think it's super cool to go to other spaces and share info with them, so we can each find out how to be more excellent.

2015-01-28 16:31 <hef> neat
2015-01-28 16:32 <hef> I wonder if we could talk justin into using an rt queue, or at least looking at one
2015-01-28 16:32 <hef> info@ get's requests for soap/paper towels
2015-01-28 16:32 <hef> I'd like to actually do something with them
2015-01-28 16:35 <DoormanDave> `justin: can we talk you into using an RT queue?
2015-01-28 16:35 <loans> hah. someone just called me personally about a potential repair
2015-01-28 16:35 <loans> and it's like well
2015-01-28 16:35 <loans> don't bring it here
2015-01-28 16:35 <hef> loans: ?
2015-01-28 16:36 <hef> why would somone call you personally?
2015-01-28 16:36 <loans> because it's someone i've worked with before
2015-01-28 16:36 <DoormanDave> I suspect other members would like to work on things in a building maintenance queue.
2015-01-28 16:36 <DoormanDave> does skilton RT?
2015-01-28 16:36 <hef> no, he doesn't
2015-01-28 16:36 <negkandcaffeine> I doubt Skilton is averse to RT if it becomes useful.
2015-01-28 16:36 <hef> well, I havn't actually triued
2015-01-28 16:36 <negkandcaffeine> s/is/would be/
2015-01-28 16:36 <loans> skilton does email though
2015-01-28 16:36 <loans> so even if he didn't RT
2015-01-28 16:36 <loans> he could be assigned tickets
2015-01-28 16:36 <Toba__> negkandcaffeine: Dat screen.
2015-01-28 16:36 <DoormanDave> true
2015-01-28 16:36 <negkandcaffeine> He's been more than comfortable with wiki and Trello.
2015-01-28 16:37 <hef> seems fair.  I made it a personal policy to let skilton be as he always did good stuff on his own
2015-01-28 16:37 <hef> perhaps that was not the best approach
2015-01-28 16:37 <DoormanDave> yeah, I'd say lets get a building maintenance queue going, even if `justin hates RT and will never use it to save a puppy on a burning bridge.
2015-01-28 16:38 <loans> i don't believe justin hates RT
2015-01-28 16:38 <negkandcaffeine> ACTION hides his stash of sacrificial puppies.
2015-01-28 16:39 <hef> I want to do a mass closing of treasury queue stuff
2015-01-28 16:39 <DoormanDave> I don't think so either, but in that case, I say we still do a building maintenance queue, I'd work on stuff in a building maintenance queue maybe.
2015-01-28 16:39 <hef> ^ works for me
2015-01-28 16:39 <Toba__> I think there is some building maint shit in trello.
2015-01-28 16:39 <Toba__> that should be transferred
2015-01-28 16:39 <DoormanDave> yeah
2015-01-28 16:39 <Toba__> not sure how relevant that is anymore though
2015-01-28 16:39 <Toba__> it could all be stale, but I don't think so
2015-01-28 16:39 <DoormanDave> I'll probably shuffle things that I'm likely to take up out of trello cause I hate that shit
2015-01-28 16:40 <Toba__> yeah, if you do - id make a column for 'moved to rt'
2015-01-28 16:40 <DoormanDave> good suggestion
2015-01-28 16:40 <Toba__> to clarify the diff between done & moved to rt
2015-01-28 16:40 <Toba__> i do that at work for shit i move to jira
2015-01-28 16:40 <DoormanDave> yeah
2015-01-28 16:40 <loans> i'd be okay with killing trello
2015-01-28 16:40 <Toba__> it works well
2015-01-28 16:40 <loans> just 100%
2015-01-28 16:41 <Toba__> I really do like the trello mobile app
2015-01-28 16:41 <Toba__> but
2015-01-28 16:41 <DoormanDave> meh, I don't see any point in making a big effort to get the tasks migrated, just do the tasks and migrate some lengthier ones
2015-01-28 16:41 <Toba__> APPS FOR THE APP GOD, SACRIFICE IT AND DRINK YOUR FILL
2015-01-28 16:41 <DoormanDave> stop using it once we've cleared more tasks
2015-01-28 16:41 <hef> DoormanDave: I'd be a fan of making it not a thing, just to not do user management on it
2015-01-28 16:42 <DoormanDave> I'm a big fan of kayako and rememberthemilk personally for support tracking/todo tracking type junk
2015-01-28 16:43 <DoormanDave> I'm not suggesting that, just saying that's what I've used for this sort of stuff at my last 2 jobs.
2015-01-28 16:43 <DoormanDave> also used trello a bit at the webhosting company I worked for
2015-01-28 16:43 <DoormanDave> that's where I developed my distaste for it, I haven't spent much time in ours.
2015-01-28 16:44 <`justin> DoormanDave: an rt queue specifically for space maintenance would be useful
2015-01-28 16:44 <t_j> just put all that shit in rt
2015-01-28 16:44 <t_j> why do we need more than one system?
2015-01-28 16:44 <hef> booyah
2015-01-28 16:44 <hef> `justin: I was concerned that creating such a thing without talking to you might be rude.
2015-01-28 16:44 <t_j> All we need is a new queue called "Pipe Dreams"
2015-01-28 16:44 <loans> t_j: accretion
2015-01-28 16:44 <agocs> t_j: more systems is better
2015-01-28 16:45 <agocs> s/better/bigger and harder to manage/
2015-01-28 16:45 <DoormanDave> We'll call it "Hardening the org"
2015-01-28 16:46 <Toba__> t_j: nice
2015-01-28 16:46 <Toba__> pipe dreams queue +1
2015-01-28 16:47 <`justin> hef: go for it
2015-01-28 16:47 <DoormanDave> I believe we already have misnamed that queue "Financial" =P
2015-01-28 16:47 <Toba__> rimshot.wav
2015-01-28 16:47 <hef> I mark those as resolved with a "do it yourself" but in a friendly way

2015-01-28 16:51 <hef> combine that with the mediawiki-runjobs service on wiki.ad and it should help
2015-01-28 16:51 <DoormanDave> hef: whoa!
2015-01-28 16:51 <DoormanDave> thanks
2015-01-28 16:51 <DoormanDave> I was just gonna scrape the db
2015-01-28 16:51 <agocs> negkandcaffeine: What is this place?
2015-01-28 16:51 <DoormanDave> and parse it out of the template tags
2015-01-28 16:51 <hef> hah, this is one instance where semantic mediawiki is actually easier
2015-01-28 16:52 <negkandcaffeine> agocs: Basement of the Board of Trade building, so I hear. Nackle suggested it last week.
2015-01-28 16:52 <agocs> negkandcaffeine: Sounds good tome
2015-01-28 16:52 <negkandcaffeine> Tomb.
2015-01-28 16:52 <negkandcaffeine> Tombuhbuhbuhbuhbuh.
2015-01-28 16:52 <hef> I added a tag to the equipmentpage template to inject semantic data from the value field
2015-01-28 16:52 <agocs> http://www.cellarsmarketchicago.com/cellars/index.php
2015-01-28 16:52 <hef> so walking that list and fixing things should be easier
2015-01-28 16:52 <agocs> ohhh haha
2015-01-28 16:53 <agocs> The name â€œCellars Marketâ€ is a twofold play on words. The financial term â€œsellerâ€™s marketâ€ derives from a market condition characterized by high prices and a supply of commodities falling short of demand. The food court, located in the buildingâ€™s basement, was renamed Cellars Market in 1992.
2015-01-28 16:53 <negkandcaffeine> Did they actually pun explain?
2015-01-28 16:53 <negkandcaffeine> Jesus.
2015-01-28 16:53 <agocs> yes
2015-01-28 16:53 <hef> That is in the BOT, right?
2015-01-28 16:54 <hef> indeed it is
2015-01-28 16:54 <agocs> negkandcaffeine: To be fair, I got the second meaning but not the first
2015-01-28 16:54 <DoormanDave> hah https://wiki.pumpingstationone.org/Hello_Kitty_Fort is on there with a value.  We better make sure that gets documented with the insurance agent
2015-01-28 16:54 <hef> agocs: it's in the Chicago Board of Trade, the pun is a little more obvious with that context
2015-01-28 16:54 <asl2> If I ever work at the BOT I will write a bot called botbot
2015-01-28 16:55 <agocs> hef: I was still thinking "Cellar Market" and not "Cellars Market"
2015-01-28 16:55 <DoormanDave> I used to colo at the CBoT
2015-01-28 16:55 <asl2> I used to work in the CME building, but not for the CME itself
2015-01-28 16:55 <DoormanDave> the datacenter I worked at was a block south in the Western Union Telegraph building.
2015-01-28 16:56 <DoormanDave> which is kinda an awesome building/DC

2015-01-28 16:57 <negkandcaffeine> Oh, my company is officially not renewing the lease on this office come May 31st.
2015-01-28 16:57 <Toba__> hm, interesting stuff http://chicagowoodworking.com/
2015-01-28 16:58 <negkandcaffeine> So I'll be descending from the 97th floor to either somewhere between the loop stops and Ogilvie/Union Station or, potentially, some office in the suburbs. Whiiiich would imply a two hour commute each way.

2015-01-28 16:59 <negkandcaffeine> sylphiae: I'm wondering if "We moved the office another hour away" counts for unemployment payments.
2015-01-28 16:59 <DoormanDave> negkandcaffeine: it does
2015-01-28 16:59 <`justin> if my company moved out to the suburbs, i would either start working from home every day, or i would just find a new job
2015-01-28 16:59 <DoormanDave> actually, I think it has to be like 20 miles
2015-01-28 17:00 <`justin> negkandcaffeine: probably does
2015-01-28 17:00 <loans> negkandcaffeine: two hour commute sucks don't do it

2015-01-28 21:21 <NegativeK> Man.
2015-01-28 21:21 <`justin> oh
2015-01-28 21:21 <NegativeK> I should've just taken the Grizzly lathe, stuck an off-center part in the chuck, and plugged that in.
2015-01-28 21:21 <`justin> i will judge robots randomly
2015-01-28 21:22 <NegativeK> "Look at how crappy it is!"
2015-01-28 21:22 <agocs> NegativeK: ahahahaha
2015-01-28 21:22 <`justin> with the rules that i make up randomly
2015-01-28 21:22 <sylphiae> notice that the other 2 judges are in the dark about the rules
2015-01-28 21:22 <agocs> Justin's gonna be like "stop damaging the arena"
2015-01-28 21:22 <sylphiae> we'll just have to make them up as well
2015-01-28 21:22 <NegativeK> Notice that if they weren't, it wouldn't affect the outcomes. <.<
2015-01-28 21:22 <`justin> point to NegativeK!
2015-01-28 21:23 <sylphiae> i guess "note" would have been less awkward...
2015-01-28 21:23 <sylphiae> i still dont' get the baby bear thing, NegativeK 
2015-01-28 21:23 <NegativeK> Three bears story.
2015-01-28 21:23 <NegativeK> Mama and papa bear's things were always unpleasant; baby bear was just right.
2015-01-28 21:24 <sylphiae> yay, i'm just right:) 
2015-01-28 21:24 <NegativeK> SO THEY SAY
2015-01-28 21:24 <loans> was the baby bear less complicit in the almost-certain grizzly mmurder of poor goldilocks?
2015-01-28 21:24 <`justin> i thought she ran away
2015-01-28 21:24 <NegativeK> Hmm, don't remember the ending to that story.
2015-01-28 21:24 <NegativeK> ~pun loans++
2015-01-28 21:24 <loans> she was asleep when the bears got back
2015-01-28 21:25 <loans> no way she ran away
2015-01-28 21:25 <NegativeK> Also, under Texas law, they could totally shoot Goldilocks.
2015-01-28 21:25 <`justin> or maybe they had bbq
2015-01-28 21:25 <`justin> and baby bear's goldilocks stew was just right
2015-01-28 21:25 <NegativeK> "The old woman starts up, jumps from the window, and runs away never to be seen again."
2015-01-28 21:25 <NegativeK> Old woman? I thought she was a girl.
2015-01-28 21:25 <sylphiae> http://imgur.com/78QYinx 
2015-01-28 21:25 <`justin> under texas law, the bears would have the right to their own arms
2015-01-28 21:25 <CarlFK> NegativeK: like the rest of us, she grew up :(
2015-01-28 21:26 <NegativeK> Oh, jeez. Wikipedia says the woman was "impudent, bad, foul-mouthed, ugly, dirty and a vagrant deserving of a stint in the House of Correction"
2015-01-28 21:26 <`justin> and anywhere else in the US, i guess
2015-01-28 21:26 <agocs> Ooooohhhh
2015-01-28 21:26 <sylphiae> what, is the origin of goldlilocks the grimms brothers or something
2015-01-28 21:26 <sylphiae> *grimm
2015-01-28 21:26 <agocs> The robot arena is *that* side up
2015-01-28 21:27 <NegativeK> Heh, it would be neat if robots just fell off when they went out.

2015-01-28 21:29 <AlexZaman> you say that because you haven't seen my tin foil costume :)

2015-01-28 21:32 <NegativeK> Jesus is my autopilot.
2015-01-28 21:32 <loans> `justin: will there be bonus points for procrastination, or the use of hot glue as a structural material

2015-01-28 23:58 <CarlFK> ok ok c2c3! c2c3! 
2015-01-28 23:58 <CarlFK> that was odd.
2015-01-28 23:58 <Toba> very
2015-01-28 23:59 <DoormanDave> so this python devops gig is gonna be sweet I think
2015-01-29 00:00 <DoormanDave> they don't do any CI right now, so just getting that rolling for them right off the bat will be impressive as fuck.
2015-01-29 00:01 <hef> DoormanDave: nice, I like easy wins like that
2015-01-29 00:01 <CarlFK> indeed 
2015-01-29 00:01 <hef> and yeah, I still want to get jenkisn up and running again for ps1
2015-01-29 00:01 <hef> jenkins
2015-01-29 00:02 <DoormanDave> what's that cloudy one I see all over github?  been meaning to look into that
2015-01-29 00:02 <DoormanDave> Travis-ci 
2015-01-29 00:02 <hef> I don't think you can run your own instance
2015-01-29 00:02 <DoormanDave> that's what I was thinking of
2015-01-29 00:04 <DoormanDave> but yeah, this app is all django, redis, mongodb, all on AWS shit, and they want me to redesign their deployment infrastructure to be less dependent on AWS and able to move infrastructure to a colo
2015-01-29 00:05 <hef> makes sense
2015-01-29 00:06 <DoormanDave> then their also wanting to move some of their django apps to flask
2015-01-29 00:06 <DoormanDave> cause their really not using the ORM, just the routing features
2015-01-29 00:06 <DoormanDave> so that's fun
2015-01-29 00:06 <DoormanDave> anyone here ever use twisted?
2015-01-29 00:08 <DoormanDave> I love the fact that showing someone Dockerbot led to a job offer and not them running and screaming in horror =P
2015-01-29 00:08 <agocs> jobofferbot
2015-01-29 00:15 <CarlFK> technically I have use twisted.   but it was before I knew python.  or what a deferred was.  so it was fail.
2015-01-29 00:15 <hef> django + mongo was a bit odd
2015-01-29 00:15 <hef> I imagine if you replaced the template enging with jinja2
2015-01-29 00:16 <hef> there isn't much of a reason to stick with django
2015-01-29 00:16 <Toba> the models and ORm
2015-01-29 00:16 <Toba> if you're tied to them
2015-01-29 00:16 <hef> I mean if you aren't using models
2015-01-29 00:16 <Toba> there's a lot of djangoisms that make it hard to switch an app away from django if you invested in them heavily
2015-01-29 00:16 <Toba> oh
2015-01-29 00:16 <Toba> if you're not using models
2015-01-29 00:16 <Toba> you're not using a lot of the other things too
2015-01-29 00:16 <Toba> since a lot of them only work if you're using the models
2015-01-29 00:16 <Toba> so yeah
2015-01-29 00:16 <hef> yeah, the template engine can be switched out easily
2015-01-29 00:16 <Toba> you're 100% right
2015-01-29 00:16 <DoormanDave> they're also moving some stuff out of mongo to psql evidently
2015-01-29 00:16 <hef> so that leaves routing
2015-01-29 00:17 <DoormanDave> which I'm stoked about, because running psql shit is easy.
2015-01-29 00:17 <hef> If they are switching to psql, they might find the models useful
2015-01-29 00:17 <DoormanDave> not fully, just the more staticly schema'd things
2015-01-29 00:18 <DoormanDave> the terrifying bit is that they don't really have backups other than the persistent EBS of two of their replicated mongodb hosts, nor any way to back out deployments.  They want me to fix that =P
2015-01-29 00:19 <Toba> jesus
2015-01-29 00:19 <Toba> no backups... yikes
2015-01-29 00:19 <hef> sounds like psone
2015-01-29 00:19 <DoormanDave> and only on two of the nodes, the rest of the mongo nodes aren't even persistent
2015-01-29 00:20 <DoormanDave> no monitoring or alerting outside of AMI stuff
2015-01-29 00:22 <DoormanDave> sounds like fun =D

2015-01-29 02:15 <DoormanDave> i wonder how many msgs i queued up.
2015-01-29 02:15 <loans> i almost had it
2015-01-29 02:15 <loans> i was gonna do it
2015-01-29 02:15 <DoormanDave> hah
2015-01-29 02:15 <DoormanDave> I got it

2015-01-29 02:15 <loans> call
2015-01-29 02:16 <DoormanDave> then realized that I had a shitload of messages queued probably =P
2015-01-29 02:16 <loans> FYI: for future reference everyone - ssh into sally and run $ sudo systemctl stop zirc
2015-01-29 02:17 <zirc> dockerbot says sorry about the spam.
2015-01-29 02:18 <DoormanDave> or kick that sun'mbitch
2015-01-29 02:18 <loans> that too
2015-01-29 02:18 <DoormanDave> haha
2015-01-29 02:18 <DoormanDave> okay I won't abuse the bots
2015-01-29 02:18 <DoormanDave> I blame loans 
2015-01-29 02:18 <loans> i did plant the seed
2015-01-29 02:19 <loans> i should stop trying to run infinite loops on every potentially exploitable bot
2015-01-29 02:19 <loans> but it's just so much fun
2015-01-29 02:19 <DoormanDave> in conclusion, dockerbot works now, please try to break it more.
2015-01-29 02:20 <loans> you guys wanna hear something weird
2015-01-29 02:20 <DoormanDave> also: killing the bot has no affect on the dockers running, loans.
2015-01-29 02:20 <loans> someone at ILC has already set up a company computer for me
2015-01-29 02:20 <DoormanDave> but it will listen if you tell it to die =(
2015-01-29 02:20 <loans> DoormanDave: good to know
2015-01-29 02:20 <DoormanDave> loans: I hate that shit
2015-01-29 02:21 <DoormanDave> I used to bitch at my co worker for wasting time setting up the new guys shit before they get there
2015-01-29 02:21 <loans> DoormanDave: it beats me using my personal computer for six months and walking over to someone else's station to access company software
2015-01-29 02:21 <DoormanDave> that's true
2015-01-29 02:21 <loans> until the GM yells at crappy manager
2015-01-29 02:21 <loans> who then gives me a p4 winxp box
2015-01-29 02:21 <DoormanDave> but in a linux shop, with linux sysadmins, they don't typically do much their first couple of days, so unboxing their shit and letting them get it set up how they like it is a nice courtesy IMO
2015-01-29 02:22 <loans> if i was working in computers, i'd be down
2015-01-29 02:22 <loans> i need email and whatever software they use 
2015-01-29 02:22 <loans> so
2015-01-29 02:26 <loans> can you even set up a windows box how you like it
2015-01-29 02:27 <loans> i usually moved the start bar to the top i guess
2015-01-29 02:27 <bjonnh> that's customization
2015-01-29 02:27 <hef> I can install shells and notepad++ and stuff
2015-01-29 02:27 <hef> not all places let you install software on your desktop
2015-01-29 02:27 <bjonnh> I would be really sad having to work with a locked computer
2015-01-29 02:27 <loans> i guess if you gave me a windows box to use day-to-day at this point i'd probably install cygwin
2015-01-29 02:28 <bjonnh> but IÂ would also spend less time geeking around

2015-01-29 02:39 <`justin> if you install git, you get git bash with it
2015-01-29 02:39 <`justin> which is basically just bash
2015-01-29 02:40 <`justin> and it works decently
2015-01-29 02:40 <`justin> if you need random linux commands
2015-01-29 02:40 <loans> i mean, i don't anticipate actually needing to fake a linux shell on a work computer any time soon
2015-01-29 02:41 <loans> i would probably try to compile fish anyway
2015-01-29 02:42 <loans> oh wait, i don't have to
2015-01-29 02:42 <loans> it's built in

2015-01-29 02:45 <`justin> fish is built into windows?

2015-01-29 03:50 <`justin> bry: i'm rolling dice to determine the winner in the case of a draw
2015-01-29 03:51 <`justin> and doing modifiers to the rolls where needed
2015-01-29 03:51 <`justin> i'm thinking a natural 20 should be a crit hit/instant win
2015-01-29 03:51 <greetermon> '73 Fiat cylinder
2015-01-29 03:51 <`justin> maybe i'll find a way to do crit threat
2015-01-29 03:51 <`justin> like
2015-01-29 03:52 <`justin> crit threat means you'll win the match automatically, regardless of your opponent's points
2015-01-29 03:52 <`justin> but if you roll again for the crit hit, you can get bonus points in the tournament
2015-01-29 03:52 <`justin> yeah
2015-01-29 03:52 <`justin> i think i can make that work

2015-01-29 15:02 <skay> holy crap last night I had a dream where for some reason you guys decided not to have zirc post about the door in irc but email me all the events instead
2015-01-29 15:03 <skay> why would I have that dream
2015-01-29 15:03 <loans> skay: good idea, i'll submit an issue
2015-01-29 15:03 <hef__> I don't ever want to see member's treated as customers
2015-01-29 15:03 <loans> hef__: i'm bothered by the 'customers' analogy too
2015-01-29 15:03 <hef__> skay: that is a strangely specific dream
2015-01-29 15:03 <`justin> our members are not customers
2015-01-29 15:04 <`justin> not even in any kind of legal sense
2015-01-29 15:04 <`justin> our members are stakeholders
2015-01-29 15:04 <hef__> ^ better
2015-01-29 15:04 <`justin> we have a vested (non-monetary) interest in the success of the org
2015-01-29 15:05 <`justin> that statement, btw, is vaguely paraphrased from a description of NFPs that I read a while back
2015-01-29 15:05 <`justin> mostly on the difference between shareholders and stakeholders
2015-01-29 15:05 <hef__> skay: I'm not sure anyone has ever dreamed about my software before
2015-01-29 15:05 <`justin> and different types of orgs
2015-01-29 15:06 <skay> hef__: I have software dreams sometime
2015-01-29 15:06 <skay> I've had code review dreams too. sometimes I have these weird dreams that are too much like reality and work
2015-01-29 15:06 <hef__> I have had a work dream before
2015-01-29 15:06 <skay> as opposed to the honestly weird dreams, which are cool
2015-01-29 15:07 <hef__> I was really pissed off, because then I ahd to go to work

2015-01-29 15:07 <Toba> i was coding on this last night

2015-01-29 15:07 <Toba> :D
2015-01-29 15:07 <Toba> AW yeah
2015-01-29 15:07 <hef__> wifi dht22?
2015-01-29 15:08 <skay> hef__: those kinds of dreams annoy me because sometimes I can remember if I sent the email for real or it was just in a dream
2015-01-29 15:08 <skay> s/can/can't
2015-01-29 15:08 <loans> Toba: pretty sweet
2015-01-29 15:08 <skay> okay back to work
2015-01-29 15:08 <hef__> hmm, I should go to work
2015-01-29 15:09 <Toba> hef__: the dht22 isn't there yet, but... it's sending the packets from the microcontroller and they're being understood by the broker
2015-01-29 15:09 <Toba> so
2015-01-29 15:09 <Toba> pretty damn close
2015-01-29 15:09 <hef__> neat
2015-01-29 15:09 <hef__> I'm in crunch mode at work
2015-01-29 15:09 <hef__> so I'm jealous of projects atm
2015-01-29 15:09 <hef__> I think, is where that thought goes
2015-01-29 15:10 <loans> Toba: start reading a GPIO and you've built your first actual sensor
2015-01-29 15:10 <loans> the 'is it on' sensor
2015-01-29 15:10 <Toba> I guess I should do that first
2015-01-29 15:10 <Toba> good tip :)
2015-01-29 15:10 <Toba> but right now i'm hand compiling glibc from 2010

2015-01-29 15:37 <loans> it's actually kind of weird
2015-01-29 15:38 <bjonnh> Toba: hand compiling you obviously mean converting c code to assembly on paper sheets no?

2015-01-29 18:01 <Toba> Why do you compile glibc? It is a so central piece of software that compiling it requires a lot of expertise! Installing a newer distribution (perhaps in a chroot-ed environment) is probably simpler. â€“  Basile Starynkevitch May 2 '12 at 13:50

2015-01-29 18:40 <t_j> agocs: pretty much :)
2015-01-29 18:41 <t_j> but with planned routes including accomodation for multi day trips and sigh seeing stuff etc
2015-01-29 18:41 <t_j> *sight
2015-01-29 18:43 <agocs> I could imagine some interest. Probably not every week, but you could probably find enough people to schedule a tour every other month or so for 5-10 guest vehicles and 1-2 host vehicles
2015-01-29 18:43 <agocs> That's an off-the-cuff number with no data to back it up
2015-01-29 18:43 <t_j> every week would be to hard

2015-01-29 18:44 <agocs> yeah. I mean, you probably couldn't replace your income with it
2015-01-29 18:44 <agocs> at least not immediately

2015-01-29 19:09 <agocs> It's a triangle that's nether equilateral or isosceles 
2015-01-29 19:09 <agocs> Third kind of triangle, when you're classifying triangles by relative leg lengths
2015-01-29 19:09 <NegativeK> Equilateral => isosceles.
2015-01-29 19:09 <NegativeK> But perhaps not colloquially.

2015-01-29 20:22 <loans> what do you want to know?
2015-01-29 20:23 <agocs> Hey stevi_ 
2015-01-29 20:23 <stevi_> I work for a non-profit called Public Lab, we are looking to run an event in the Chicago area and was wondering a little bit about this group and space. 
2015-01-29 20:24 <loans> stevi_: your very best bet would be to come to one of our Tuesday open houses - if you have specific questions, please feel free to ask them

2015-01-29 20:24 <stevi_> I would love to stop by, but I actually work in New Orleans. 
2015-01-29 20:25 <hef> Were we in press recently?
2015-01-29 20:25 <hef> stevi_: what would you like to know
2015-01-29 20:25 <stevi_> I was referred to you through a contact of mine. 
2015-01-29 20:25 <NegativeK> "Chicago building full of hackers fails to burn itself down yet again."
2015-01-29 20:26 <hef> stevi_: well, to start with, most of the people in this channel would consider the space run by the membership.
2015-01-29 20:26 <stevi_> Ok thank you.
2015-01-29 20:26 <agocs> I consider the space to be run by a cabal of reptoid aliens that live under the Dailey Center
2015-01-29 20:27 <hef> stevi_: so if you ask about how the space is run, you will get a lot of different answers

2015-01-29 20:29 <stevi_> I'm thinking we'll have around 30 people.

2015-01-29 20:30 <bry> or public guests who would want to come. we do stuff like that sometimes too
2015-01-29 20:30 <stevi_> The event would be open, and we're always looking for more people. 
2015-01-29 20:30 <loans> shoot a message there - if any members are interested in working with you, they'll get in touch
2015-01-29 20:31 <bry> Sorry, we have to make that super clear, people sometimes get the wrong impression
2015-01-29 20:31 <hef> 30 might be doable.  They would be effectively taking over the space for day.  stevi_: you just need to find a member to sponsor the event, and it can happen.  follow the link loans posted and post there.

2015-01-29 21:10 <sylphiae> just tape things together and it'll do
2015-01-29 21:10 <DoormanDave> tape is pretty high tech
2015-01-29 21:10 <NegativeK> I'm worried about the metal in my robot.
2015-01-29 21:11 <DoormanDave> ACTION just sticks an LED blinkie on boss and enters him
2015-01-29 21:11 <sylphiae> we will allow manual powered robots, but parts of your body cannot stay in the arena
2015-01-29 21:11 <sylphiae> so you can like push your robot
2015-01-29 21:11 <sylphiae> or drop it from a ramp
2015-01-29 21:11 <DoormanDave> Can Boss be a robot?
2015-01-29 21:11 <DoormanDave> he tends not to move unaided
2015-01-29 21:12 <sylphiae> boss is a dog right? 
2015-01-29 21:12 <DoormanDave> yeah
2015-01-29 21:13 <sylphiae> my personal judge opinion is no...
2015-01-29 21:13 <sylphiae> you can appeal to the other 2 judges
2015-01-29 21:14 <agocs> DoormanDave: Would you feel comfortable with Boss facing Blender Blending Rodriguez?
2015-01-29 21:15 <carlfk_> agocs: better, it's a butane detector ;P
2015-01-29 21:16 <agocs> carlfk_: an open flame

2015-01-29 21:18 <DoormanDave> that is badass
2015-01-29 21:18 <NegativeK> DoormanDave: Let's make one out of sheet metal.
2015-01-29 21:19 <DoormanDave> NegativeK: lets make the "swinging mandrel table saw" out of that lincoln welding project book
2015-01-29 21:20 <NegativeK> I think I'll stick with klein bottles.
2015-01-29 21:20 <agocs> sylphiae: I know my robot can't damage the arena
2015-01-29 21:20 <NegativeK> Because that sounds terrifying.
2015-01-29 21:20 <agocs> but what if I weld a circular saw blade to an AC motor?
2015-01-29 21:20 <DoormanDave> found it! https://archive.org/stream/farmequi00jame#page/10/mode/2up
2015-01-29 21:20 <bjonnh> weld a circular saw to a gasoline engine
2015-01-29 21:20 <bjonnh> better, after some gearboxes,
2015-01-29 21:20 <DoormanDave> 3hp gasoline engine
2015-01-29 21:21 <DoormanDave> yep
2015-01-29 21:21 <agocs> I'll just pull the 6 cylinder out of my jeep
2015-01-29 21:21 <bjonnh> enough to see the metal from the blade expands under centrifuge effect
2015-01-29 21:21 <agocs> 192hp circular saw

2015-01-29 21:22 <DoormanDave> nice
2015-01-29 21:22 <DoormanDave> carlfk_: I'm onto you.
2015-01-29 21:23 <bjonnh> but for now its not changing personality yet
2015-01-29 21:23 <bjonnh> I have to do that manually
2015-01-29 21:23 <bjonnh> carlfk_: DoormanDave said that he is into you
2015-01-29 21:23 <carlfk_> : drawing them as it happens. or maybe has a bunch ready for stuff like it has been discussed on the el last night you needed a 1/2" bolt, would you know what
2015-01-29 21:23 <agocs> DoormanDave: Would you want Boss fighting this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtWgSytWkE&feature=em-upload_owner

2015-01-29 21:24 <DoormanDave> agocs: Boss is his own dog, he can decide once he meets Blender.
2015-01-29 21:25 <agocs> Fair enough
2015-01-29 21:26 <t_j> agocs: did you just call boss a dumb robot?
2015-01-29 21:27 <agocs> t_j: Not on purpose
2015-01-29 21:27 <agocs> I've met boss
2015-01-29 21:27 <agocs> I know he's a sweet puppy
2015-01-29 21:29 <DoormanDave> I called him a dumb robot
2015-01-29 21:29 <NegativeK> Bless his heart.
2015-01-29 21:30 <sylphiae> Toba: yes? 
2015-01-29 21:30 <sylphiae> you paged me
2015-01-29 21:30 <DoormanDave> t_j: https://archive.org/stream/farmequi00jame#page/10/mode/2up lets make one of these for the woodshop day.
2015-01-29 21:30 <Toba> how existential is kierkegaard on a scale of 1 to "What even is 'what is', anyway?"
2015-01-29 21:31 <t_j> DoormanDave: that blade is just not large enough
2015-01-29 21:31 <t_j> and 3hp is pretty pewney
2015-01-29 21:31 <NegativeK> Let's make our own blade.
2015-01-29 21:31 <DoormanDave> it's true, it should probably be bigger and faster and stronger.
2015-01-29 21:31 <t_j> NegativeK: thats your task
2015-01-29 21:31 <NegativeK> And just strap it onto your truck, t_j.
2015-01-29 21:31 <DoormanDave> lets just double the recipe.
2015-01-29 21:31 <Toba> sylphiae: if you ceased to exist and thus can't answer the question, that's fine
2015-01-29 21:31 <t_j> DoormanDave: that seems reasonable
2015-01-29 21:32 <Toba> I already purchased a material good that ocntains a recorded portion of kierkegaard's thoughts and ideas
2015-01-29 21:32 <sylphiae> i would give him like an 8
2015-01-29 21:32 <t_j> DoormanDave: 600cc motorcycle engine would be perfect for the drive
2015-01-29 21:32 <agocs> t_j: Ping Toba's brother for how to build a truck-mounted crane, then throw a saw on that
2015-01-29 21:32 <sylphiae> sorry, i'm working
2015-01-29 21:32 <Toba> ha
2015-01-29 21:32 <Toba> I can ask my brother for "documentation" of the jeepcrane if you want.
2015-01-29 21:32 <DoormanDave> sawcrane
2015-01-29 21:33 <sylphiae> uh, well you should have fun with your physical kierkegaard
2015-01-29 21:33 <DoormanDave> Always a crowd pleaser
2015-01-29 21:33 <t_j> Toba: jeepcrane?
2015-01-29 21:33 <sylphiae> ACTION slightly confused that she is being asked for philosophy advice
2015-01-29 21:33 <sylphiae> maybe surprised is better
2015-01-29 21:33 <Toba> he took a long piece of pipe
2015-01-29 21:33 <Toba> mounted it to his bumper using a bolt hinge
2015-01-29 21:33 <Toba> put a block and tackle on it
2015-01-29 21:33 <Toba> cabled it onto the frame to hold it up
2015-01-29 21:33 <Toba> and used a winch
2015-01-29 21:33 <Toba> he's lifted engines
2015-01-29 21:33 <Toba> other jeeps
2015-01-29 21:33 <t_j> huh
2015-01-29 21:33 <Toba> and he's planning to use it to lower a full size bridgeport mill into his basement
2015-01-29 21:34 <t_j> there are truck bed mounted lifts
2015-01-29 21:34 <NegativeK> O.O
2015-01-29 21:34 <Toba> let me try to find a pic
2015-01-29 21:34 <agocs> t_j: http://i.imgur.com/Abfxf.jpg
2015-01-29 21:34 <agocs> Toba: ^^
2015-01-29 21:34 <Toba> yeah. that.
2015-01-29 21:34 <sylphiae> anything that will not fit into the arena is automatically disqualified > .< 
2015-01-29 21:34 <Toba> that's his back yard
2015-01-29 21:34 <Toba> sylphiae: this isn't a dumb robot
2015-01-29 21:34 <Toba> it's a dumb crane
2015-01-29 21:34 <Toba> that my brother owns 1000 miles from here
2015-01-29 21:35 <DoormanDave> that's awesome
2015-01-29 21:35 <Toba> right?
2015-01-29 21:35 <t_j> Toba: what does he do for a living?
2015-01-29 21:35 <Toba> currently, he does embedded electronics for the avionics system of the terrefugia transition
2015-01-29 21:36 <agocs> flying cars
2015-01-29 21:36 <Toba> I think you and he would get along, t_j
2015-01-29 21:36 <sylphiae> i'm just reminding the other contestants:P 
2015-01-29 21:36 <Bioguy> senor abrazos conforms to all the rules!
2015-01-29 21:36 <NegativeK> Senor Abrazos is a conformist!
2015-01-29 21:36 <Bioguy> ACTION hugs NegativeK
2015-01-29 21:36 <DoormanDave> Toba: was your brother home schooled as well?
2015-01-29 21:36 <NegativeK> Unilowbrow ignores rules and just spins on.
2015-01-29 21:36 <Toba> DoormanDave: yes
2015-01-29 21:37 <t_j> Toba: why dont you have him come crain your old car away?
2015-01-29 21:37 <DoormanDave> ACTION high five
2015-01-29 21:37 <Toba> he's a bit uh, far from here.
2015-01-29 21:37 <NegativeK> Make the crane bigger.
2015-01-29 21:37 <NegativeK> DUH.
2015-01-29 21:37 <NegativeK> !duh
2015-01-29 21:37 <Toba> Oh. Ok.
2015-01-29 21:37 <Bioguy> Senor Abrazos went to a public school.
2015-01-29 21:37 <NegativeK> !sudlowbutt
2015-01-29 21:37 <t_j> i'm sure jeepcrane would survive a 2000 mile road trip
2015-01-29 21:37 <DoormanDave> I don't know if sprongy will fit in the arena
2015-01-29 21:37 <DoormanDave> i don't even have a sprongy yet
2015-01-29 21:37 <Toba> I do'nt know if jeepcrane would actually solve the problem
2015-01-29 21:37 <NegativeK> Cheapjeepcrane.
2015-01-29 21:37 <agocs> I'm not sure Jeepcrane is registered to handle the journey
2015-01-29 21:38 <Toba> If it was up to me, I would just have it towed away for scrap.
2015-01-29 21:38 <Bioguy> Senor Abrazos would actually solve the problem.
2015-01-29 21:38 <t_j> it had a plate on it
2015-01-29 21:38 <agocs> Toba: What is the problem and why can't I solve it with four wheel drive?
2015-01-29 21:38 <Toba> The problem is that donna's old car that won't move itself is in the parking space assigned to our home
2015-01-29 21:38 <Toba> and it's not actually her car, it's her uncle's
2015-01-29 21:38 <Toba> so we can't just get it towed to a junkyard and forget it
2015-01-29 21:38 <DoormanDave> yeah sounds like just the problem for a jeep crane.
2015-01-29 21:38 <Toba> we have to get it to her uncle's garage.
2015-01-29 21:38 <Toba> It does.
2015-01-29 21:39 <NegativeK> Drive down the road with a car dangling from a jeep crane.
2015-01-29 21:39 <Toba> Excpet lifting and towing aren't the same thing, really
2015-01-29 21:39 <DoormanDave> t_j: why doesn't your truck have a crane?!
2015-01-29 21:39 <Toba> I should get a tow strap
2015-01-29 21:39 <Toba> those work
2015-01-29 21:39 <Toba> but I don't know if they're street legal...
2015-01-29 21:39 <t_j> DoormanDave: it as a 12k lbs cap winch and snatch blocks
2015-01-29 21:39 <Toba> fun additional fact: the car is not registeed or insured anymore.
2015-01-29 21:39 <Toba> this introduces some side issues
2015-01-29 21:39 <agocs> It *may* be illegal to drive on the streets
2015-01-29 21:39 <DoormanDave> pull it with a few pedicabs
2015-01-29 21:39 <Toba> alleys aren't streets though
2015-01-29 21:39 <agocs> if we move it at, like, 4 am, that's an issue
2015-01-29 21:40 <agocs> Toba: How far is the parking space from the garage?
2015-01-29 21:40 <Toba> like... 30 minute drive 
2015-01-29 21:40 <agocs> hm
2015-01-29 21:40 <Toba> it's not right around the corner
2015-01-29 21:40 <agocs> yeah
2015-01-29 21:40 <Toba> if it was, i'd risk it
2015-01-29 21:40 <Toba> fuck it, if it was a couple blocks i'd put in neutral and push.
2015-01-29 21:40 <NegativeK> Does Uncle have a mechanics garage?
2015-01-29 21:40 <Toba> he does.
2015-01-29 21:40 <Toba> no towtruck though
2015-01-29 21:41 <Toba> nor any time to care about this problem
2015-01-29 21:41 <t_j> ok you need a uhaul flat tow trailer, and a second vehcle with a reciver
2015-01-29 21:41 <NegativeK> Boo to that.
2015-01-29 21:41 <DoormanDave> sounds like you need you a tow truck
2015-01-29 21:41 <NegativeK> t_j's not insane and probably right.
2015-01-29 21:41 <DoormanDave> and your brother has one, but you have to pay one anyway.  That sucks Toba.
2015-01-29 21:41 <NegativeK> Tow truck == $$$$. But also not a problem.
2015-01-29 21:41 <agocs> Toba: I'd be willing to pull the tow trailer
2015-01-29 21:41 <t_j> that way we can winch it onto the trailer with my winch while the other truck holds teh trailer in place
2015-01-29 21:41 <DoormanDave> hah good call
2015-01-29 21:42 <Toba> truck on truck on trailer on car action
2015-01-29 21:42 <Toba> I like where this is going
2015-01-29 21:42 <NegativeK> ACTION calls Brazzers.
2015-01-29 21:42 <Toba> haha
2015-01-29 21:42 <t_j> agocs: you would not be able to rent a trailer from uhaul with a soft top, but you would be usefull when loading
2015-01-29 21:42 <agocs> t_j: I know. U-haul rules chap my buns
2015-01-29 21:42 <Toba> wait, what?
2015-01-29 21:42 <Toba> what uhaul rule fucks this up?
2015-01-29 21:42 <agocs> But yeah, I'll hold the trailer in place for ya
2015-01-29 21:43 <agocs> Toba: t_j can pick up and move the trailer, since his truck is a truck
2015-01-29 21:43 <t_j> Toba: uhaul have rules on what they will let tow what
2015-01-29 21:43 <DoormanDave> agocs: what's your truck?
2015-01-29 21:43 <Toba> oh, trucks that aren't trucks can't tow trailers for trucks?
2015-01-29 21:43 <agocs> My truck has a floppy top, and U-haul thinks that's risky and won't let me rent a trailer
2015-01-29 21:43 <t_j> Toba: and soft/open top jeeps are not on the allowed list
2015-01-29 21:43 <agocs> DoormanDave: Jeep Wrangler, cloth top
2015-01-29 21:43 <Toba> that doesn't make sense
2015-01-29 21:43 <Toba> but good to know
2015-01-29 21:43 <DoormanDave> ah
2015-01-29 21:43 <Toba> I don't get why that is the case
2015-01-29 21:43 <hef> http://www.twitch.tv/netherrealm
2015-01-29 21:43 <t_j> Toba: 8am sunday?

2015-01-29 21:44 <Toba> I'll call the uhaul place tomorrow

2015-01-29 22:21 <bjonnh> t_j: you're a vim user right?
2015-01-29 22:21 <t_j> bjonnh: aye
2015-01-29 22:21 <bjonnh> t_j: how long does it take to startup?
2015-01-29 22:21 <agocs> 8, 10 minutes at most
2015-01-29 22:21 <bjonnh> hah
2015-01-29 22:21 <t_j> bjonnh: errrrr about 20 mins, gotta get breakfast and take a shower
2015-01-29 22:21 <t_j> anyway sub second
2015-01-29 22:22 <t_j> i.e. I type vim<enter> and its open
2015-01-29 22:22 <NegativeK> Text editor start up time is a thing people notice?
2015-01-29 22:22 <t_j> i dont use plugins though
2015-01-29 22:22 <NegativeK> I've got a couple of saved 10-file sessions that start instantly.
2015-01-29 22:22 <bjonnh> no I was wondering
2015-01-29 22:22 <agocs> NegativeK: run emacs and see how long that takes to start
2015-01-29 22:23 <NegativeK> $ emacs
2015-01-29 22:23 <NegativeK> bash: emacs: command not found
2015-01-29 22:23 <DoormanDave> even with plugins, if you're taking a noticable amount of time to start vim you're doing it wrong.
2015-01-29 22:23 <bjonnh> mine takes around 3 secs for first start
2015-01-29 22:23 <bjonnh> but il also loads my email client and my agenda
2015-01-29 22:23 <NegativeK> Ahhh.
2015-01-29 22:23 <DoormanDave> NegativeK: you are doing it right =P
2015-01-29 22:23 <DoormanDave> oh man
2015-01-29 22:23 <NegativeK> DoormanDave: It'll take however long it takes for apt-get to install emacs, apparently. >.>
2015-01-29 22:23 <DoormanDave> now that I don't work with lisp, I'll never be tempted to learn emacs again
2015-01-29 22:24 <t_j> DoormanDave: google thinks i'm steve still :(
2015-01-29 22:24 <bjonnh> anymay as soon as it has been started once, I have an emacs server, so next instances are instantaneous
2015-01-29 22:24 <DoormanDave> t_j: that's cool just change your name to Steve Farkas.
2015-01-29 22:24 <DoormanDave> It's a pretty good name right?
2015-01-29 22:24 <NegativeK> Hm, fancy.
2015-01-29 22:26 <DoormanDave> t_j: shows up as Tom Judge for me...

2015-01-29 22:39 <bjonnh> I still have to learn how to do that
2015-01-29 22:40 <NegativeK> Someone write a bot that accepts PMs and echos them to zirc.
2015-01-29 22:40 <NegativeK> That way zirc can be completely untrustable!

2015-01-29 22:43 <loans> NegativeK: maybe it will be a heads up to how shitty this place is

2015-01-29 22:43 <NegativeK> "We've hired five replacements and they all quit first day."
2015-01-29 22:43 <Toba> that sounds workable

2015-01-29 22:45 <agocs> That's how you're going to afford to stay in Willis
2015-01-29 22:46 <Toba> and you could sell reduced price redactions.

2015-01-29 22:47 <loans> i like the idea of having no idea what the status of a message is
2015-01-29 22:47 <agocs> NegativeK: That way, several people get to see pictures of your dick
2015-01-29 22:47 <loans> you can burn a redaction but you don't know if it was successful

2015-02-03 13:43 <hef_> I adjusted my dashboard to have "10 newest unowned tickets in general queue"

2015-02-03 16:29 <bjonnh> t_j: well Virtualbox is almost dead
2015-02-03 16:29 <loans> i thought i would be primarily fixing gear, she thinks i should primarily be helping with getting fixtures tested in
2015-02-03 16:29 <bjonnh> t_j: and I can't run kvm together with virtualbox
2015-02-03 16:29 <t_j> bjonnh: why is vbox dead?
2015-02-03 16:29 <loans> i would not have taken this job if the latter was presented as my primary duty, so i hope she is wrong
2015-02-03 16:29 <kuroishi> loans: ah that sucks
2015-02-03 16:30 <bjonnh> t_j: because they have less and less devs (only 4 now)
2015-02-03 16:30 <bjonnh> t_j: and because oracle is managing it and they don't really care about the quality of their software
2015-02-03 16:30 <bjonnh> but that second point is only my opinion
2015-02-03 16:31 <kuroishi> yeah i think it will just become oracalized until no one uses it

2015-02-03 16:53 <bry> and was tossing it out after the first one?
2015-02-03 16:54 <hef> The "Other" test was cleaning up after itself
2015-02-03 16:54 <bry> that makes sense, but sounds maddening
2015-02-03 16:54 <hef> It was
2015-02-03 16:54 <hef> It works now
2015-02-03 16:54 <hef> so yay for progress
2015-02-03 16:59 <hef> I was remembering a story you told where running the unit tests concurrently broke them
2015-02-03 16:59 <hef> So it never crashed on single core computers
2015-02-03 16:59 <hef> but always crashed on dual core
2015-02-03 17:00 <hef> unless you ran the single failed test
2015-02-03 17:00 <hef> you know, to investigate why it was failing
2015-02-03 17:00 <kuroishi> hahah
2015-02-03 17:00 <kuroishi> hahhaha
2015-02-03 17:00 <kuroishi> that must have been super frustrating
2015-02-03 17:01 <hef> bry was quite distraught, if I recall correctly
2015-02-03 17:01 <kuroishi> ugh
2015-02-03 17:01 <kuroishi> i'm kinda anxious about getting back into software stuff, I was sorta hoping to go back into hosting I think.
2015-02-03 17:02 <kuroishi> devops is the best of both worlds =P
2015-02-03 17:02 <kuroishi> or worst =P
2015-02-03 17:02 <mstrb> worst
2015-02-03 17:02 <bry> the state of unit tests here is catastrophic
2015-02-03 17:02 <kuroishi> the devs at lisp shop were big fans of dropping failed tests
2015-02-03 17:03 <kuroishi> which I always found endlessly amusing
2015-02-03 17:03 <bry> someone set it up 
2015-02-03 17:03 <bry> to where it recreated the entire local test db
2015-02-03 17:03 <bry> everytime you ran a set of tests
2015-02-03 17:03 <kuroishi> I don't know the nature of the failing tests in most cases, but just watching the fails and then the ever dwindling number of total tests was amusing to me

2015-02-03 17:06 <hef> kuroishi: there were a few tests I pulled out of ps1auth
2015-02-03 17:06 <hef> they were testing no longer valid things
2015-02-03 17:06 <hef> although I probably would have fixed them if I had CI
2015-02-03 17:06 <kuroishi> haha
2015-02-03 17:06 <bry> god, I still have to set jenkins up
2015-02-03 17:06 <kuroishi> we should totally get jenkins up

2015-02-03 17:07 <bry> jenkins is a straightforward kinda guy
2015-02-03 17:07 <`justin> something about "firedrill" and "spearhead" and other such silly words
2015-02-03 17:08 <kuroishi> yeah, he's just like "Y/N?" then will show you logs of how he reached his decision.
2015-02-03 17:08 <kuroishi> maybe some storm clouds.

2015-02-03 17:14 <bry> oh, haha
2015-02-03 17:14 <bry> the reviews indicate that it is very pretty, but light on data you need
2015-02-03 17:14 <bry> and focuses too much on random encounters and traveling
2015-02-03 17:16 <Toba> The Federal Bureau of Investigation put Anonymous hacker Jeremy Hammond on a secret terrorist watchlist, according to confidential records obtained by the Daily Dot. The records further reveal how the FBI treats cybercrimes and shines a rare light on the expanding definitions of terrorism used by U.S. law enforcement agencies.
2015-02-03 17:16 <Toba> great news
2015-02-03 17:16 <Toba> :(
2015-02-03 17:17 <hef> Sounds like something Jeremy would be on
2015-02-03 17:17 <bry> what'd they do?
2015-02-03 17:17 <Toba> it's a chicago based dude
2015-02-03 17:17 <Toba> who was in anonymous
2015-02-03 17:17 <Toba> he was the guy who did the stratfor hack
2015-02-03 17:18 <Toba> he came to ps1 a couple times a few years ago and everyone thought he was a self aggrandizing asshole
2015-02-03 17:18 <Toba> from what i can tell
2015-02-03 17:18 <Toba> from what I hear
2015-02-03 17:18 <Toba> but
2015-02-03 17:18 <hef> He was at UIC
2015-02-03 17:18 <Toba> did you know him there? 
2015-02-03 17:18 <Toba> or just know people who did
2015-02-03 17:18 <bry> oh
2015-02-03 17:18 <bry> he's the backdoor UIC guy
2015-02-03 17:18 <Toba> effectively this just means that a lot of us in this chat are nearly certainly being watched by the NSA
2015-02-03 17:19 <kuroishi> I lived with the dude
2015-02-03 17:19 <Toba> we knew that already, I guess, but we *really* know it now

2015-02-03 17:27 <kuroishi> that said, both those dudes deserve to be locked up.

2015-02-03 17:31 <t_j> flagged down a leo to control traffic and pulled him out
2015-02-03 17:31 <kuroishi> yah the bike lane lines are nice there =)
2015-02-03 17:32 <t_j> they need to put cones on the lanes of the 90/94 off ramp to stop people going straight on from the right lane
2015-02-03 17:32 <kuroishi> so what do people just burn up their engines spinning their wheels when they get stuck?
2015-02-03 17:32 <kuroishi> why all the car fires?
2015-02-03 17:32 <t_j> basicly yes
2015-02-03 17:32 <t_j> and snow/ice blocking the air from the radiators

2015-02-03 17:35 <agocs> "Twenny five if ya help me load it inna my truck"
2015-02-03 17:35 <NegativeK> Because now you have to get that fucker out and find somewhere to put it.
2015-02-03 17:35 <t_j> NegativeK: in your appartment should work
2015-02-03 17:36 <NegativeK> It might very well be longer than my apartment.
2015-02-03 17:36 <kuroishi> my apartment is long
2015-02-03 17:36 <agocs> NegativeK: At ten bucks, I could probably just strip out the copper wires and scrap it
2015-02-03 17:36 <NegativeK> Definitely is longer than my apartment.
2015-02-03 17:36 <kuroishi> we can just crane it in after removing my roof.
2015-02-03 17:36 <NegativeK> Don't normal homes have something like a 2 ton AC unit?
2015-02-03 17:36 <t_j> kuroishi: i'm sure it will remove your roof just fine if we put it on that
2015-02-03 17:36 <NegativeK> 1.5-4 ton. That thing has 15.
2015-02-03 17:37 <NegativeK> 4 kw laser on the PS:1 roof.
2015-02-03 17:37 <kuroishi> pew pew
2015-02-03 17:38 <kuroishi> agocs: just get sshc to take out like 15 more units on that side of the building
2015-02-03 17:38 <NegativeK> Use the laser to open up the sides of the building.
2015-02-03 17:38 <kuroishi> ^
2015-02-03 17:38 <NegativeK> And a few mirrors.

2015-02-03 17:42 <NegativeK> Pulse jet.
2015-02-03 17:42 <t_j> yes if its not melted already
2015-02-03 17:43 <Toba> I guess I don't actually drive very far usually
2015-02-03 17:43 <Toba> so I don't think I would be able to melt my engine or light it on fire in a 15 minute drive in this weather.
2015-02-03 17:43 <Toba> but I will anyway.

2015-02-03 17:45 <Toba> silly walking uses silly muscles
2015-02-03 17:45 <Toba> that normally don't do much
2015-02-03 17:45 <NegativeK> Silly exercise.
2015-02-03 17:46 <Toba> hm
2015-02-03 17:46 <Toba> anyone heard from PhG
2015-02-03 17:46 <NegativeK> Fug?
2015-02-03 17:48 <NegativeK> Coworker is Turing testing a telemarketer.
2015-02-03 17:48 <agocs> haha

2015-02-03 17:51 <Toba> hah
2015-02-03 17:51 <Toba> wow
2015-02-03 17:52 <skay> I wish I could do this http://corvidresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/available-phd-position-in-cognitive.html
2015-02-03 17:52 <Toba> burds
2015-02-03 17:52 <NegativeK> Boids.
2015-02-03 17:55 <Toba> great
2015-02-03 17:55 <Toba> it's snowing again tonight
2015-02-03 17:55 <Toba> and again tomorrow night
2015-02-03 17:55 <Toba> only less than an inch each time, but still.
2015-02-03 17:55 <NegativeK> :D
2015-02-03 17:55 <NegativeK> I got my good socks and good boots on. Bring it on, pretty falling flakes!
2015-02-03 17:56 <t_j> Toba: 3 inches tonight 
2015-02-03 17:56 <t_j> according to NWS
2015-02-03 17:57 <skay> CarlFK: ^ ugh no drive to ps1
2015-02-03 17:57 <skay> CarlFK: take bus or skip it
2015-02-03 17:57 <CarlFK> why not?
2015-02-03 17:57 <skay> CarlFK: because finding a parking space makes me cry
2015-02-03 17:57 <t_j> you have jeep you can go anywhere
2015-02-03 17:57 <skay> CarlFK: and we can't park on elston
2015-02-03 17:57 <t_j> oooh elston is a snow route
2015-02-03 17:57 <Toba> yes
2015-02-03 17:57 <Toba> it is
2015-02-03 17:57 <Toba> #hahafuck
2015-02-03 17:58 <Toba> yeah I'm not going to ps1 tonight
2015-02-03 17:58 <Toba> 2 days in a row is enough.
2015-02-03 17:58 <Toba> any votes?
2015-02-03 17:58 <NegativeK> Toba: Brown line to 152 bus.
2015-02-03 17:58 <skay> bus or taxi
2015-02-03 17:58 <NegativeK> BAM PS:1 without the parking.
2015-02-03 17:58 <Toba> naaaaaaah.
2015-02-03 17:58 <agocs> Is the 2" Snow thing in effect?
2015-02-03 17:58 <Toba> agocs: depends how much of a fuck parking enforcement gives
2015-02-03 17:58 <NegativeK> agocs: It's in effect whenever 2" accumulates.
2015-02-03 17:58 <Toba> I forgot to put a permit sticker on my car on sunday night and nothing happeend
2015-02-03 17:58 <skay> agocs: the signs say that. so unless there is a countermand that is not on the sign then yes
2015-02-03 17:58 <t_j> phone the alderman
2015-02-03 17:58 <Toba> in effect yes, being enforced ?????
2015-02-03 17:59 <agocs> Toba, NegativeK: I've heard it only goes into effect when the Streets & Sanitation commissioner decides it is
2015-02-03 17:59 <t_j> on sunday/monday it was not being enforced
2015-02-03 17:59 <Toba> ...really?
2015-02-03 17:59 <Toba> weird
2015-02-03 17:59 <NegativeK> Ah, huh.
2015-02-03 17:59 <t_j> aldermans office will be able to tell you
2015-02-03 17:59 <skay> Toba: I don't want more parking tickets. they pile up and CarlFK doesn't pay them and then he goes to australia and then I have to go downtown in person to get the boot removed
2015-02-03 17:59 <Toba> I guess "shit is not clear enough for all the cars in the city to be somewhere, if i enforce this'
2015-02-03 17:59 <Toba> is a good reason not to.
2015-02-03 17:59 <Toba> skay: hah
2015-02-03 18:00 <Toba> why not just pay them immediately online?
2015-02-03 18:00 <Toba> CarlFK: whyyyyyyyY?????
2015-02-03 18:00 <agocs> http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/streets/provdrs/street/svcs/snow_clearing_winterof2012-2012.html
2015-02-03 18:00 <CarlFK> Toba: cuz im dumb.
2015-02-03 18:00 <Toba> k
2015-02-03 18:00 <agocs> "While the 2-inch snow ban is not activated often, motorists who are parked within the restricted area could receive a ticket or find that their vehicle has been relocated in order to facilitate snow clearing operations."
2015-02-03 18:00 <Toba> me too.
2015-02-03 18:00 <skay> that has 2012 in the url
2015-02-03 18:00 <CarlFK> skay: Id rather drop you off and find parking than deal with buss 
2015-02-03 18:00 <Toba> "find that their vehicle has been relocated"
2015-02-03 18:00 <Toba> ha
2015-02-03 18:00 <skay> CarlFK: when will I see you again?
2015-02-03 18:01 <CarlFK> lol
2015-02-03 18:01 <skay> it could be days
2015-02-03 18:01 <Toba> that's a polite way to put "towed to the fucking impound and under 2 inches of frozen mud"
2015-02-03 18:01 <skay> you might have to park all the way back at our house
2015-02-03 18:02 <CarlFK> I'll drive around with a CHAIN and pull someone out who is stuck
2015-02-03 18:02 <NegativeK> Roof parking!
2015-02-03 18:02 <CarlFK> and then take their spot
2015-02-03 18:02 <CarlFK> and ski to ps1.
2015-02-03 18:02 <CarlFK> I wish I knew where my boots are.  storage I bet
2015-02-03 18:03 <NegativeK> CarlFK: Any snowboards?
2015-02-03 18:03 <CarlFK> i got no snowboards 
2015-02-03 18:03 <NegativeK> I'm'a go snowboarding on Friday.
2015-02-03 18:03 <CarlFK> neat - break something on your last run
2015-02-03 18:03 <t_j> NegativeK: break a neck
2015-02-03 18:04 <CarlFK> that would be rad.  but don't die.  
2015-02-03 18:04 <skay> insted of using something freaky like inotify, is this and a cronjob okay enough? I am not a real sysadm http://paste.ubuntu.com/10038682/
2015-02-03 18:04 <t_j> skay: no
2015-02-03 18:04 <NegativeK> Sweet pipes holding up my floppy head, bro.
2015-02-03 18:05 <t_j> you have race and will loose data
2015-02-03 18:05 <t_j> skay: hard link the file, then replace the node being logged to with a new file
2015-02-03 18:06 <CarlFK> well.. if apache is creating the file, there is no doing all that stuff
2015-02-03 18:06 <skay> t_j: wow, I am clueless. what does that mean? 
2015-02-03 18:06 <bjonnh> hmmm nice pdf virus in an emf file
2015-02-03 18:06 <CarlFK> which is why you should suck it up and use inotify
2015-02-03 18:06 <skay> t_j: there are some machines that are writing apache logs, and they have cron jobs that sanitize out PII. I can rsync those. and then process with my django app
2015-02-03 18:07 <skay> t_j: it all sucks, but it existed this way before I got here, and they didn't automate anything
2015-02-03 18:07 <skay> t_j: I've been half-baked learning how to do enough sysadm stuff to be able to automate as much as I can
2015-02-03 18:08 <skay> like, why ddidn't someone a long time just make a real end point and then not need to scrape the logs?
2015-02-03 18:08 <CarlFK> skay: pretty sure inotify is the way to go, and learning it will pay off 
2015-02-03 18:08 <mstrb> inotify is cool an stuff but tbh i would use it sparingly just for maintainability
2015-02-03 18:08 <mstrb> the next person who comes along is gonna be wtf is this
2015-02-03 18:08 <zirc> Door Unlocked
2015-02-03 18:08 <skay> CarlFK: oh sure, learn some arcane thing that I have never used and which I will use in a broken way and also what mstrb just said
2015-02-03 18:08 <NegativeK> Achievement Unlocked
2015-02-03 18:09 <CarlFK> skay:  better than trying to figure out the workarounds like t_j mentioned  (
2015-02-03 18:09 <skay> CarlFK: what did t_j mean up there? what is that crazy moon language? what am I linking and and replacing?
2015-02-03 18:10 <skay> CarlFK: and can I do whatever he said when I don't have access to the machine?
2015-02-03 18:10 <CarlFK> ohh.. you don't have access?  no, and no inotivey either.
2015-02-03 18:10 <skay> CarlFK: I think I can get a specific firewall rule and something defined in a daemonified rsync thing (hand waving) so that I can run an rsync command against a machine I have no other access to
2015-02-03 18:11 <mstrb> you can do rsync over ssh
2015-02-03 18:11 <skay> CarlFK: but I am not a sysadm so I could have some incorrect assumptions there
2015-02-03 18:11 <skay> mstrb: I don't think that's how they want to do it? I don't know.
2015-02-03 18:11 <skay> mstrb: I am talking to real ops people
2015-02-03 18:11 <mstrb> ok
2015-02-03 18:12 <mstrb> i'm not seeing the race t_j mentioned
2015-02-03 18:12 <skay> mstrb: but they are not doing all of this. they are setting up just enough so I can have access to the same thing that someone had access to who kjnow longer works there
2015-02-03 18:12 <skay> mstrb: I think there is a thinko in >rsync_changes.log so that will clobbered at least
2015-02-03 18:12 <t_j> copy file while process is writing to it
2015-02-03 18:12 <CarlFK> t_j: don't have access to that fs
2015-02-03 18:13 <skay> t_j: what am I copying it while something is writing?
2015-02-03 18:13 <mstrb> i don't see a copy
2015-02-03 18:13 <t_j> hard link it, remove the write name, create new write file, copy off the linked version
2015-02-03 18:13 <t_j> rsync is a copy
2015-02-03 18:13 <t_j> skay: the log file
2015-02-03 18:13 <CarlFK> box A: apache, logs, sanitizer drops files foo1, foo2... on A's fs.  box B rsyncs foo* to B.
2015-02-03 18:14 <t_j> you have to make box a rotate the log before you touch it
2015-02-03 18:14 <skay> t_j: If I don't have permissions to access the remote file system, I guess I could change the rsync command to only touch the rotated logs
2015-02-03 18:14 <CarlFK> t_j: that one way but not a have to ;)
2015-02-03 18:14 <skay> t_j: I didn't think about that. thanks for the catch
2015-02-03 18:14 <`justin> NegativeK: seconds of what?
2015-02-03 18:14 <mstrb> i don't agree
2015-02-03 18:15 <NegativeK> `justin: Fame?
2015-02-03 18:15 <NegativeK> Gotta hand off the torch if I end up taking the photography class.
2015-02-03 18:15 <skay> mstrb: help out
2015-02-03 18:15 <mstrb> i'm probably wrong
2015-02-03 18:15 <t_j> mstrb: if apache writes while rsync is fetching rsync will not get the same file
2015-02-03 18:16 <mstrb> it'll get it next time
2015-02-03 18:16 <CarlFK> rsync is not getting the apache logs
2015-02-03 18:16 <t_j> mstrb: undefined, how is the log rotated on box a
2015-02-03 18:17 <skay> oh derp
2015-02-03 18:17 <CarlFK> skay: what keeps the sanitizer from overwriting it's previous output?  (somehow I think it makes a new filename each time)
2015-02-03 18:17 <skay> yeah, it's getting files that were apache files, but not
2015-02-03 18:18 <skay> and a cron job runs periodically to add the files to the dirs I am rsyncing
2015-02-03 18:18 <skay> CarlFK: I'm gonna go with never quote the membership agreement or bylaws from memory and link to the source
2015-02-03 18:20 <skay> skay: oh it's some cron job somewhere, amd I'm too lazy to dig any more. but yes, different file names. no clobbering
2015-02-03 18:20 <NegativeK> Man. Aiming to go snowboarding on Friday, and I've never skied or snowboarded.
2015-02-03 18:20 <NegativeK> I'm going to accidentally kill someone.
2015-02-03 18:21 <CarlFK> NegativeK: no, you are going to go 5' and fall on your face.
2015-02-03 18:21 <`justin> NegativeK: i can host the next 300s
2015-02-03 18:21 <NegativeK> CarlFK: And then have my feet fly off, the board flip across the slope, and someone die.
2015-02-03 18:21 <NegativeK> `justin: <3
2015-02-03 18:21 <CarlFK> you need to learn how to stay up for more than 30 seconds before you are leathel 
2015-02-03 18:21 <mstrb> t_j: k yeah i was wrong
2015-02-03 18:21 <mstrb> but it sounds like these files are not being actively logged to
2015-02-03 18:21 <`justin> is it next week?
2015-02-03 18:22 <NegativeK> `justin: Week from today, yeah.
2015-02-03 18:22 <`justin> someone make an announcement at the meeting tonight
2015-02-03 18:22 <`justin> i won't be there
2015-02-03 18:22 <NegativeK> I'll announce.
2015-02-03 18:22 <`justin> i'll post something on the list
2015-02-03 18:22 <NegativeK> <3<3
2015-02-03 18:22 <NegativeK> Heart pile!
2015-02-03 18:23 <NegativeK> Toba: If it doesn't fucking suck, we should do a skiing/snowboarding thing there.
2015-02-03 18:23 <skay> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7XW-mewUm8
2015-02-03 18:23 <skay> NegativeK: ^ I don't know who QA is in that clip
2015-02-03 18:24 <skay> NegativeK: I think they would be on a jet that goes in front of that plane, and then the QA team abseils off the jet through one of the holes in toa passenger seat
2015-02-03 18:24 <skay> or maybe where no seat is first
2015-02-03 18:24 <skay> to check the no seat condition
2015-02-03 18:24 <skay> you can skydive out
2015-02-03 18:24 <skay> or maybe bungee back up
2015-02-03 18:24 <skay> also you throw geeze in to the engines
2015-02-03 18:24 <skay> geese
2015-02-03 18:24 <NegativeK> Why the fuck.
2015-02-03 18:25 <NegativeK> Would you brag about building a plane in the air as a metaphor for your software?
2015-02-03 18:25 <`justin> well
2015-02-03 18:25 <skay> I know hahahaha
2015-02-03 18:25 <`justin> apparently i didn't win the superbowl square thing in my office
2015-02-03 18:25 <`justin> oh well
2015-02-03 18:25 <NegativeK> skay: QA goes around and sits in the passenger seats before the passengers do.
2015-02-03 18:25 <NegativeK> Definitely throws birds at the plane.
2015-02-03 18:26 <NegativeK> Tries to light shit on fire, rip wings off..
2015-02-03 18:26 <skay> NegativeK: birds turn in to a trout and then slap you in the face. this is no fair
2015-02-03 18:26 <skay> NegativeK: kicks a dev in the nuts
2015-02-03 18:26 <skay> or ovaries
2015-02-03 18:26 <skay> gonads
2015-02-03 18:26 <`justin> QA is the guy flying the plane while they put it together
2015-02-03 18:26 <zirc> Richard Williams is a new full member as of 2015-02-03 12:19:35-06:00
2015-02-03 18:27 <NegativeK> Pulls bolts out of the plane and replaces them with horsehair bolts.
2015-02-03 18:27 <NegativeK> Dumps 500 pound bags of concrete down the toilet.
2015-02-03 18:27 <skay> NegativeK: oh that reminds me of this awesome scene in Red Mars in the first book when they are on their way to mars
2015-02-03 18:27 <NegativeK> Walks around smoking an entire pack of cigarettes; puts the oxygen mask on the kid before themself.
2015-02-03 18:27 <skay> NegativeK: that book is so old that spoiler shouldn't matter right? it's so small
2015-02-03 18:27 <NegativeK> skay: No spoil; it's good.

2015-02-03 18:28 <NegativeK> Don't spoil; it's a good book.
2015-02-03 18:28 <skay> NegativeK: you remember the scene?

2015-02-03 18:51 <`justin> oh hmm
2015-02-03 18:51 <`justin> i'm gonna wait until later tonight to send the email about 300s next week
2015-02-03 18:51 <`justin> so people won't get confused and think it's tonight
2015-02-03 18:52 <Toba> Good plan
2015-02-03 18:52 <loans> the best plan maximises potential confusion
2015-02-03 18:53 <Toba> That is an interesting assertion.
2015-02-03 18:53 <`justin> oh right
2015-02-03 18:53 <`justin> "Hey everyone, we're going to be having 300secondsoffame for the next 300seconds
2015-02-03 18:53 <`justin> and the next 300secons after that."
2015-02-03 18:53 <`justin> "Pretty much for the rest of eternity"
2015-02-03 18:53 <`justin> "Everything I just said is a lie!"
2015-02-03 18:53 <`justin> "Except that"
2015-02-03 18:54 <tac_> I miss 300 seconds of fame
2015-02-03 18:54 <tac_> In the sense that, by course of habit, I tend to miss every 300 seconds of fame held at PS1
2015-02-03 18:54 <`justin> tac_: your 300 seconds of fame begins now!
2015-02-03 18:54 <`justin> tac_: next week...
2015-02-03 18:54 <Toba> This fits into my image of tac_ who strives to make life difficult and unpleasant for himself.
2015-02-03 18:54 <tac_> Toba: Software wasn't making my life hard enough
2015-02-03 18:55 <tac_> somehow....
2015-02-03 18:55 <Toba> Ha.
2015-02-03 18:55 <tac_> I was too skilled a programmer
2015-02-03 18:55 <tac_> bugs feared me

2015-02-03 18:59 <NegativeK> Cowboy wants everyone using wired on their laptops so wifi bandwidth is available for phones and people with their laptop away from their desks.
2015-02-03 18:59 <`justin> loans: yes, i imagine she is tired of these threads and just responded on instinct
2015-02-03 18:59 <NegativeK> ...we have ten employees.

2015-02-03 19:00 <`justin> NegativeK: tell him to stop giving the wifi password to the hobos that wait outside the office
2015-02-03 19:00 <NegativeK> He said "wifi bandwidth" and I responded with "what, for the people torrenting?"
2015-02-03 19:00 <Toba> So that's a "yes, sort of"
2015-02-03 19:02 <NegativeK> I'm pretty sure Knuth's "Premature optimization is the root of all evil" was written as a prediction for Cowboy.
2015-02-03 19:03 <Toba> That's taken out of context too much.
2015-02-03 19:03 <NegativeK> 92% of his micromanaging is premature optimization.

2015-02-03 19:16 <sylphiae> don't you usually wear sandals when it's warm out anyways? 
2015-02-03 19:16 <`justin> that could be recharged by walking
2015-02-03 19:16 <`justin> well
2015-02-03 19:16 <`justin> the idea was that i would be able to continue wearing sandals when it was cold out

2015-02-03 20:24 <B1oguy> "A ghost of his former self."
2015-02-03 20:24 <Toba> I think my collected bots are my ghost.
2015-02-03 20:24 <`justin> B1oguy: north of green street was where it was at
2015-02-03 20:24 <Toba> so sure.
2015-02-03 20:24 <NegativeK> God damn these dark chocolate covered almonds are fucking delicious.
2015-02-03 20:24 <Toba> B1oguy: too mean
2015-02-03 20:24 <`justin> south of green street was a foreign country
2015-02-03 20:24 <B1oguy> Toba: sorry. :(
2015-02-03 20:25 <B1oguy> `stupid beckman institute
2015-02-03 20:25 <NegativeK> Former Evil Board.
2015-02-03 20:25 <`justin> most of us actually believed you needed a passport to go down there
2015-02-03 20:25 <`justin> all those crazy liberal arts kids were down there
2015-02-03 20:26 <B1oguy> I was an engineering student... once...
2015-02-03 20:26 <`justin> B1oguy: chem annex had a window near the entrance that looked like it went into a basement
2015-02-03 20:26 <B1oguy> befroe I transferred into Lost And Searching my senior year
2015-02-03 20:26 <`justin> but it actually went into the steam tunnels
2015-02-03 20:26 <`justin> i figured this out one day
2015-02-03 20:26 <B1oguy> `justin ;)  Yes.  Yes.  Steam tunnels.
2015-02-03 20:27 <`justin> when i went out through that window ;-)
2015-02-03 20:27 <B1oguy> :D
2015-02-03 20:30 <CarlFK> steam tunnels?
2015-02-03 20:30 <bry> http://imgur.com/gallery/rTpSWF5
2015-02-03 20:31 <B1oguy> CarlFK: At UIUC, none of the buildings had any boiler systems.  Instead, they relied on a central boiler building, which then conveyed steam to all the campus buildings.
2015-02-03 20:31 <B1oguy> They conveyed the steam through steam tunnels, which were under mosrt of the sidewalks.
2015-02-03 20:32 <NegativeK> Did they use pipes in the tunnels or just fill the entire walkway?
2015-02-03 20:32 <B1oguy> pipes
2015-02-03 20:32 <NegativeK> Damn.
2015-02-03 20:32 <NegativeK> "Okay, bring the concrete tunnels up to 2000 psi."
2015-02-03 20:32 <`justin> shit
2015-02-03 20:32 <B1oguy> The tunnels were quasi labyrinthine, so they made for fun exploring
2015-02-03 20:32 <`justin> i didn't eat lunch :-(
2015-02-03 20:32 <CarlFK> I was hoping for the whole tunnel 
2015-02-03 20:33 <CarlFK> but not really under pressure, just steam loafting about 
2015-02-03 20:33 <B1oguy> also, the sidewalks never had snow or ice ebcause they were heated by the tunnels.  This is how `justin and I could get away with not owning shoes in college.
2015-02-03 20:33 <NegativeK> CarlFK: loans may be able to get you equipment to simulate that.
2015-02-03 20:33 <`justin> ACTION did some tunnel explorin' in his day
2015-02-03 20:33 <NegativeK> Does the Chicago campus of UI have explorable steam tunnels?
2015-02-03 20:33 <imcleod> B1oguy: Do you do any exploring closer to home these days?  (I've been tempted to try a little urban exploring but haven't really pushed the issue.)
2015-02-03 20:33 <`justin> ACTION wore shoes in the winter...
2015-02-03 20:33 <NegativeK> ^^
2015-02-03 20:34 <NegativeK> Shit, not the shoes line.
2015-02-03 20:34 <`justin> not all of the sidewalks were heated...
2015-02-03 20:34 <mstrb> more snow
2015-02-03 20:34 <NegativeK> mstrb: Notably so!
2015-02-03 20:34 <NegativeK> Notably snow.
2015-02-03 20:34 <t_j> mstrb: OFN
2015-02-03 20:34 <imcleod> B1oguy: My university had central steam as well, and now has central chilled water as well.
2015-02-03 20:34 <B1oguy> imcleod: I haven't done much exploring, but I am very interested in understanding the old roads and cities that ocne made up what is now chicago.  Like for example Port Clinton Road in the n. suburbs used to lead to a town called... Port Clinton.
2015-02-03 20:34 <mstrb> ofy
2015-02-03 20:35 <B1oguy> OF i hate youa ll
2015-02-03 20:35 <B1oguy> ... port clinton is now Highland Park
2015-02-03 20:36 <`justin> they should rename the road
2015-02-03 20:36 <B1oguy> The town of Rondout, which no nothing more than where two railroad lines inetrsect, was the site of the largest train robbery in US history
2015-02-03 20:36 <NegativeK> Valdosta State University had AC tunnels.
2015-02-03 20:36 <`justin> like
2015-02-03 20:36 <`justin> they just had a bunch of tunnels that were air conditioned?
2015-02-03 20:37 <t_j> NegativeK: what like fridge tunnels?
2015-02-03 20:37 <NegativeK> Tunnels that carried chilled liquid.
2015-02-03 20:37 <NegativeK> Water, I believe.
2015-02-03 20:38 <`justin> YOU'RE A CHILLED LIQUID!
2015-02-03 20:38 <Toba> you're a supercooled liquid
2015-02-03 20:38 <NegativeK> The upgraded dorms moved away from that to individual heat exchangers.
2015-02-03 20:38 <Toba> so chill that at the slightest provocation you'll compeletely freee up
2015-02-03 20:38 <NegativeK> Freeeeeeee!
2015-02-03 20:39 <`justin> Freeeeeeze!
2015-02-03 20:39 <NegativeK> CarlFK: You do your ice slot thing this winter yet?
2015-02-03 20:40 <CarlFK> oh no.. I forgot about that.  hmm, drop skay off, drive to HD, get pipe bomb materials, bring to ps1.  build...
2015-02-03 20:40 <`justin> umm
2015-02-03 20:40 <NegativeK> Don't worry; not in the space.
2015-02-03 20:40 <NegativeK> It doesn't get cold enough.
2015-02-03 20:40 <`justin> okay
2015-02-03 20:40 <`justin> i won't worry in the space
2015-02-03 20:40 <NegativeK> It'll be right outside the door.
2015-02-03 20:40 <`justin> i will worry far away from the space
2015-02-03 20:40 <NegativeK> CarlFK: Angle grinder slot?
2015-02-03 20:40 <CarlFK> hand held hack saw is fine 
2015-02-03 20:41 <CarlFK> more control over slot size 
2015-02-03 20:41 <NegativeK> I kind of want to see what a small hole would do.
2015-02-03 20:41 <NegativeK> Iceghetti?
2015-02-03 20:42 <NegativeK> Ohhh, multiple holes in the end.
2015-02-03 20:42 <NegativeK> Raspberry Pi timelapse camera.
2015-02-03 20:42 <NegativeK> CarlFK: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

2015-02-03 21:25 <`justin> yeah, not really, lol
2015-02-03 21:25 <Toba> the HR person was either the CFO's wife
2015-02-03 21:25 <Toba> or
2015-02-03 21:25 <t_j> NegativeK: so you could have run arround naked the other day and got away with it
2015-02-03 21:25 <loans> theyre useful for reference to shit like, when is the office closed
2015-02-03 21:25 <Toba> someone who actually ended up getting fired for having a relationship with an employee

2015-02-03 21:28 <Toba> justin, I had a boss tell me that my not working more than 40 hours was a problem because my doing so was demotivating the rest of the employees from doing it.

2015-02-03 21:34 -!- ckleehammer(0ce27fd3@gateway/web/freenode/ip.12.226.127.211) has joined #pumpingstationone
2015-02-03 21:34 <NegativeK> I was expecting to be extremely disappointed (I wasn't) and I didn't expect that much gore.
2015-02-03 21:34 <Toba> this oled screen is likely going to be fun to program
2015-02-03 21:34 <`justin> NegativeK: sasha grey?
2015-02-03 21:34 <Toba> the datasheet seems to be at least partially in russian
2015-02-03 21:34 <NegativeK> Toba: The $10 one from Amazon?
2015-02-03 21:34 <Toba> yes.
2015-02-03 21:34 <Toba> I bought it
2015-02-03 21:34 <NegativeK> `justin: Close, but Liam Neeson instead.
2015-02-03 21:34 <Toba> because I have poor self control
2015-02-03 21:34 <NegativeK> Well, Amazon does that.
2015-02-03 21:34 <Toba> just one click..
2015-02-03 21:34 <ckleehammer> hey guys, was planning on coming by tonight....is it mostly permit parking?
2015-02-03 21:35 <Toba> no
2015-02-03 21:35 <kuroishi> nope
2015-02-03 21:35 <Toba> it's mostly snow route parking
2015-02-03 21:35 <Toba> so
2015-02-03 21:35 <NegativeK> ckleehammer: Nope, but Elston is towable.
2015-02-03 21:35 <kuroishi> there should be parking around
2015-02-03 21:35 <Toba> HAHAHAHAH
2015-02-03 21:35 <ckleehammer> soo no parking haha
2015-02-03 21:35 <Toba> so well
2015-02-03 21:35 <Toba> yes
2015-02-03 21:35 <Toba> there is
2015-02-03 21:35 <NegativeK> Park on side streets.
2015-02-03 21:35 <Toba> but we don't know if we can use it right now.
2015-02-03 21:35 <Toba> the side streets rae non permit.
2015-02-03 21:35 <Toba> but bring a shovel
2015-02-03 21:35 <NegativeK> ^
2015-02-03 21:35 <Toba> because the side streets are sort of a mess
2015-02-03 21:35 <NegativeK> Or talk to t_j.
2015-02-03 21:35 <kuroishi> my driveway might be shoveled out
2015-02-03 21:35 <Toba> they are dirvable now though
2015-02-03 21:35 <ckleehammer> but snow ban is in order i think?
2015-02-03 21:35 <Toba> probably.
2015-02-03 21:35 <Toba> maybe.
2015-02-03 21:35 <NegativeK> Snow ban on Elston.
2015-02-03 21:35 <`justin> side streets aren't snow route
2015-02-03 21:35 <kuroishi> should probably tell the list
2015-02-03 21:35 <ckleehammer> il just take train and hike in streets haha
2015-02-03 21:36 <`justin> hell, they might not even be plowed
2015-02-03 21:36 <NegativeK> We're near a couple of bus stops.
2015-02-03 21:36 <ckleehammer> ya they are ridiculously rough still
2015-02-03 21:36 <kuroishi> the side streets around here are pretty plowed
2015-02-03 21:36 <kuroishi> at least troy and roscoe are
2015-02-03 21:36 <NegativeK> Blue Line Addison is a 10-15 minute walk; 152 bus goes really close.
2015-02-03 21:36 <ckleehammer> thanks for heads up
2015-02-03 21:36 <NegativeK> 82 bus is halfway between Addison stop and PS:1.

2015-02-03 22:43 <NegativeK> rectangled: 8pm is when things kick off.

2015-02-03 22:44 <NegativeK> If you say "someone said I should fill out a waiver", you'll be a god amongst hackers.

2015-02-04 23:16 <NegativeK> Ohhhh, I get to find out if imgur crashes this phone when the photos are large.
2015-02-04 23:16 <NegativeK> The answer is no!
2015-02-04 23:17 <NegativeK> And the result is a sunset: http://i.imgur.com/ULz76e5.jpg

2015-02-04 23:17 <bjonnh> A complaint of a nude man throwing snowballs ended with the man being hit with a stun gun and a 24-hour emergency psychiatric commitment.
2015-02-04 23:18 <NegativeK> t_j: No other adjacent transactions?
2015-02-04 23:18 <bjonnh> When an officer announced his presence, the man, who later told police he had taken LSD, turned and ran east on Oak Street.
2015-02-04 23:18 <NegativeK> No comprende.
2015-02-04 23:18 <bjonnh> The suspect dropped to the ground as instructed by police, but he refused to stay on his stomach with his hands behind his back, and instead rolled around on the ground.
2015-02-04 23:18 <bjonnh> "During this time, whenever (he) complied with my order to roll onto his stomach, he would make an apology or ask not to be tased. However, when he rolled back onto his back he made aggressive statements," 
2015-02-04 23:18 <asl2> more fun than taking Oak and running on Lake Shore Drive
2015-02-04 23:21 <bjonnh> yep

2015-02-04 23:21 <NegativeK> Huh?
2015-02-04 23:21 <NegativeK> The receipts added together are the same as the payments added together?
2015-02-04 23:21 <t_j> yep
2015-02-04 23:22 <t_j> but the payments are messed up by a little under 10 bucks
2015-02-04 23:22 <NegativeK> Do the payments in Quickbooks match Chase?
2015-02-04 23:22 <NegativeK> That's fucking weird.
2015-02-04 23:22 <t_j> yep

2015-02-04 23:44 <t_j> NegativeK: how to know which members paid?
2015-02-04 23:44 <NegativeK> If Zoho still exists, check records modified near that date?
2015-02-04 23:44 <NegativeK> Honestly, I took it over and implemented actually tracking that shit.
2015-02-04 23:44 <NegativeK> And it wasn't instantly properly recorded in RT.
2015-02-04 23:45 <t_j> :(
2015-02-04 23:45 <NegativeK> I concur.

2015-02-04 23:48 <hef> for old stuff?
2015-02-04 23:48 <NegativeK> For mid-2014.
2015-02-04 23:48 <hef> All the zoho notes got ported over
2015-02-04 23:49 <Toba> notes, but not neccessarily history?
2015-02-04 23:49 <NegativeK> Ah. If queries for date ranges can be run, that could be helpful.
2015-02-04 23:49 <hef> like changes to member status?
2015-02-04 23:49 <NegativeK> Unlikely.
2015-02-04 23:49 <NegativeK> More likely are notes like "cash payment on <date>".
2015-02-04 23:50 <NegativeK> Cash dues, when paid timely-ly, weren't accompanied by status changes.
2015-02-04 23:50 <hef> indeed, mostly there were notes recorded when people paid

2015-02-04 23:55 <Toba> it was his genius idea to put the dart board on the side of our microwave in such a way that if you missed badly enough it went to where he always sat at his desk
2015-02-04 23:55 <Toba> he was
2015-02-04 23:56 <NegativeK> At least any filings that got in the eye would be easy to pull out.

2015-02-05 00:09 <Toba> I probably won't end up using that horrible thing
2015-02-05 00:09 <asl2> does it work under pypy?
2015-02-05 00:09 <Toba> it's just a disgusting thought that sprung to mind while doing something that so far hasn't involved doing that

2015-02-05 00:11 <asl2> https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#locals "The contents of this dictionary should not be modified; changes may not affect the values of local and free variables used by the interpreter."
2015-02-05 00:11 <asl2> it's not just a bad idea: it's against the docs
2015-02-05 00:12 <asl2> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4997184/why-is-it-bad-idea-to-modify-locals-in-python says "When inside a function call, locals() returns a combination of the  global scope and the scope local to the function. In this case,  modifying the locals() output won't make any changes to the local scope  because it's essentially using an island"
2015-02-05 00:12 <asl2> is that true?  I dunno

2015-02-05 00:19 <bry> that person decided to yell "sql rocks, learn to love it" as he was leaving
2015-02-05 00:19 <bry> he was not at all involved with the original convo
2015-02-05 00:21 <bry> I'm looking up my gpa's city
2015-02-05 00:21 <bry> to make sure I copied it down right
2015-02-05 00:21 <bry> wikipedia article As of theÂ census[2]Â of 2010, there were 184 people, 74 households, and 50 families residing in the city.
2015-02-05 00:24 <hef>  Males had a median income of $41,141 versus $25,819 for females.

2015-02-05 00:40 <schedmon> hello, kuroishi. I guess you'll be here for 8 hours or so.
2015-02-05 00:47 <hef> how are there more households than families?
2015-02-05 00:47 <hef> Does the census track related people living in different housholds?
2015-02-05 00:51 <bjonnh> shit will be late for lockpicking
2015-02-05 00:51 <bjonnh> I'll probably have a new computer, so it may be worth it

2015-02-05 03:35 <bry> so
2015-02-05 03:35 <bry> I almost got into a fight on the bus
2015-02-05 03:35 <bry> and it wasn't my fault
2015-02-05 03:39 <hef> ?
2015-02-05 03:39 <hef> what did you do?
2015-02-05 03:39 <bry> i was sitting on the bus
2015-02-05 03:40 <bry> and I glanced backwards at the seats behind me
2015-02-05 03:40 <bry> and this freaking lady decided that I was glancing disapprovingly at her
2015-02-05 03:40 <bry> and called me a bitch and said something about not looking back
2015-02-05 03:40 <bry> i ignored it
2015-02-05 03:41 <bry> she then like 30 seconds later
2015-02-05 03:41 <bry> called me a bitch again
2015-02-05 03:41 <bry> and vaguely threatened something
2015-02-05 03:42 <bry> so I looked back and told her that I was looking at the seats and to take her head out of her ass
2015-02-05 03:42 <bry> her friend told me to pull the stick out of my ass
2015-02-05 03:42 <bry> she kept talking crap
2015-02-05 03:43 <bry> I ignored it, I promise
2015-02-05 03:43 <bry> the seat opened up behind me
2015-02-05 03:43 <bry> and the friend moved over
2015-02-05 03:43 <bry> the original lady said that she should have moved over
2015-02-05 03:43 <r4v5> jfc
2015-02-05 03:43 <bry> and then she told the friend to boot up snapchat
2015-02-05 03:43 <bry> because "I'm bout to do something"
2015-02-05 03:43 <bry> i swear to god
2015-02-05 03:44 <bry> if she had touched me
2015-02-05 03:44 <bry> but she didn't do anything
2015-02-05 03:44 <bry> and just kept threatening for the next minute or so
2015-02-05 03:44 <bry> and then I got off
2015-02-05 03:44 <bry> she did not follow me
2015-02-05 03:44 <bry> and I have globally declared her to be a ho
2015-02-05 03:44 <bry> <done>
2015-02-05 03:46 <r4v5> let the record show that on this date, that woman has officially been declared 'a ho' and 'basic as fuck'
2015-02-05 03:47 <bry> and her friend sucks at insults
2015-02-05 03:49 <Toba> that's the worst of all
2015-02-05 03:49 <Toba> if you're not good at insults

2015-02-05 15:14 <sylphiae> i'd like to help you out with the seafood one next time
2015-02-05 15:14 <sylphiae> hi Bioguy
2015-02-05 15:14 <minivanmegafun> is it time for more coffee? 
2015-02-05 15:15 <Bioguy> ACTION pours out MOAR COFFEE
2015-02-05 15:15 <minivanmegafun> actually we have a flavia machine which produces a drink almost, but not quite, entirely unlike coffee
2015-02-05 15:15 <`justin> Bioguy: aren't you supposed to throw the coffee?

2015-02-05 15:16 <skay> sylphiae: no worries
2015-02-05 15:17 <Bioguy> `justin: yeah, but I am feeling lame today
2015-02-05 15:17 <Bioguy> laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame
2015-02-05 15:20 <`justin> Bioguy is laaaaaaame!
2015-02-05 15:20 <Bioguy> Is elizabeth running CNC tonight?
2015-02-05 15:20 <Bioguy> I need to build....
2015-02-05 15:20 <Bioguy> SOMETHING.
2015-02-05 15:20 <Bioguy> ACTION shifteyeyes
2015-02-05 15:20 <`justin> Bioguy: cnc build club is tonight
2015-02-05 15:20 <`justin> that's bart's event
2015-02-05 15:20 <Bioguy> YAY
2015-02-05 15:21 <Bioguy> Ah, I hate to be dim, but which instruments are used for that?  shopbot?  shapeoko?  laser cutter?
2015-02-05 15:22 <`justin> hef: i don't know if you heard about this yet, but last night we ran into a weird issue on the members site
2015-02-05 15:22 <`justin> ACTION should probably open a github issue
2015-02-05 15:22 <`justin> we had a new member try to login
2015-02-05 15:22 <`justin> and he was able to login, but then instead of having the menu up top to setup RFID and whatnot
2015-02-05 15:23 <`justin> there was just a sign in button again
2015-02-05 15:23 <sylphiae> you can also submit an RT ticket...
2015-02-05 15:24 <`justin> for an issue with the member site?
2015-02-05 15:24 <`justin> why would i do that?
2015-02-05 15:24 <sylphiae> i guess hef does work on that
2015-02-05 15:24 <sylphiae> but it can go to systems
2015-02-05 15:25 <`justin> i think filing a bug on the github repo is better for this kind of thing...
2015-02-05 15:26 <`justin> i mean, if people don't know about the github repo, the systems queue is a fine place for them to report problems
2015-02-05 15:27 <`justin> hmm
2015-02-05 15:27 <`justin> is there anyone in this channel who isn't a domain admin?
2015-02-05 15:27 <`justin> or on the board
2015-02-05 15:27 <Bioguy> I think me?
2015-02-05 15:27 <`justin> or any other special designation?
2015-02-05 15:27 <`justin> Bioguy: try logging in to the members site real quick
2015-02-05 15:27 <Bioguy> ok one sec
2015-02-05 15:28 <Bioguy> Ok logged on
2015-02-05 15:28 <Bioguy> what next?

2015-02-05 15:29 <`justin> what do you see at the top of the window?
2015-02-05 15:29 <`justin> top right
2015-02-05 15:29 <Bioguy> "sign in"
2015-02-05 15:29 <`justin> does it show your name, or does it say "sign in"?
2015-02-05 15:29 <`justin> ah
2015-02-05 15:29 <`justin> i think i know what the problem is

2015-02-05 15:48 <Toba> haha jk
2015-02-05 15:48 <Toba> I was using my own metra tracker backward, looking at outbound trains.
2015-02-05 15:49 <Toba> I should build in a feature so that it automatically switches back and forth by time of day, so if you set it to inbound in the morning, it swaps it to outbound in the evening
2015-02-05 15:49 <Toba> the UI for that would have to be pretty clever though, or it would be worse than it not doing that
2015-02-05 15:50 <asl21> if it runs on a machine that can share location, you could use that as an input
2015-02-05 15:53 <`justin> where's bry at?
2015-02-05 15:53 <`justin> bry: https://i.imgur.com/Z1h2eXX.jpg
2015-02-05 15:58 <Toba> asl21: I guess that's true, but that won't really work for non-mobiledevice use.
2015-02-05 15:58 <Toba> asl21: I should do that, if mobile is in play, though.
2015-02-05 15:58 <Toba> Good idea :)
2015-02-05 15:59 <asl2> I actually have no idea where my laptop gets the location information it sends along when I allow a website to use my location
2015-02-05 15:59 <asl2> I should set that to low earth orbit
2015-02-05 15:59 <Toba> ha

2015-02-05 16:08 <asl2> no, there is very good food in Beijing apparently
2015-02-05 16:08 <skay> excellent excellent food I bet
2015-02-05 16:08 <agocs> skay: Enjoy your food friend in transformer oil
2015-02-05 16:08 <agocs> *fried
2015-02-05 16:09 <Bioguy> skay: ha. :)  actually, the food is not bad in China.    I would recommend going to their local fast food place, whith a big image of bruce lee.
2015-02-05 16:09 <Bioguy> skay: do you have any dietary requirements?
2015-02-05 16:09 <skay> Bioguy: I need to eat food

2015-02-05 16:10 <skay> hi alesage! my next sprint is probably Beijing
2015-02-05 16:10 <asl2> I can try to ask a friend for recommendations if you want - now is bad for him (his husband is recovering from surgery).  But your coworkers would be likely to be helpful too.
2015-02-05 16:10 <skay> I bet they will be. I think some of them may have gone to university in Beijing
2015-02-05 16:10 <alesage> skay, I'm jealous, we don't have one scheduled
2015-02-05 16:10 <skay> alesage: I just found out about it today. maybe you will find out soon?
2015-02-05 16:11 <alesage> skay peut etre
2015-02-05 16:26 <t_j> skay: make sure you go to a hot pot place

2015-02-05 16:27 <t_j> and a habachi place 
2015-02-05 16:27 <skay> I went to a hot pot place for the Taipei sprint. The locals were worried about it being too spicy but it was not
2015-02-05 16:27 <t_j> and BUNS
2015-02-05 16:27 <skay> but I imagine it could probably be very spicy depending on where you are
2015-02-05 16:27 <t_j> you must try BUNS
2015-02-05 16:28 <skay> MOAR BAO

2015-02-05 16:29 <t_j> rather than having to go to /admin
2015-02-05 16:29 <hef> I won't be able to get a fix in until late tongith
2015-02-05 16:29 <hef> `justin: ah
2015-02-05 16:31 <NegativeK> Look at my gorgeous surface finish from side milling on a wiggly rotary table. Look at it! http://i.imgur.com/RYoicpF.jpg
2015-02-05 16:31 <NegativeK> That purely decorative and non-critical surface is amazeballs.
2015-02-05 16:32 <agocs> is that coolant I see?
2015-02-05 16:32 <agocs> Or is that the surface?
2015-02-05 16:32 <NegativeK> There's coolant making the surface look worse.
2015-02-05 16:32 <agocs> okay
2015-02-05 16:32 <NegativeK> Surface was quite shiny.
2015-02-05 16:33 <agocs> I'm sure triano will appreciate the new depth stop for his drill press
2015-02-05 16:34 <NegativeK> I'm just hoping it doesn't overpower the quill return spring.
2015-02-05 16:35 <agocs> I mean, it's just aluminum. It's not milled from Mjollnir, forged in the heart of a dying star.
2015-02-05 16:35 <NegativeK> Wellll... It's 3/4" steel.
2015-02-05 16:36 <agocs> Oh dang
2015-02-05 16:36 <agocs> slightly heavier
2015-02-05 16:36 <agocs> But still not mjollnir
2015-02-05 16:36 <agocs> Why'd you go with steel?
2015-02-05 16:36 <NegativeK> It's what we had.
2015-02-05 16:36 <agocs> fair enough
2015-02-05 16:37 <NegativeK> I mean, if I had ordered some aluminum plate and waited for it to arrive, I'd probably still be done sooner than now.
2015-02-05 16:37 <NegativeK> But shut up.
2015-02-05 16:37 <agocs> <3
2015-02-05 16:37 <NegativeK> ACTION wants chicken and biscuits.

2015-02-05 16:38 <agocs> NegativeK: field trip to Honey Butter instead?
2015-02-05 16:38 <Bioguy> I like dangerous bacteria!
2015-02-05 16:38 <NegativeK> agocs: You seem to think that Haute Sausage doesn't have fucking amazing chicken and biscuits.
2015-02-05 16:38 <Bioguy> ad I seek them out to protect, to not to hurt.
2015-02-05 16:38 <Bioguy> I seek them out to KILL THEM
2015-02-05 16:38 <agocs> NegativeK: do they?
2015-02-05 16:38 <Bioguy> I suppoe that makes me an anti-microbiologist
2015-02-05 16:38 <NegativeK> skay: You're kind of right. It won't be terribly fancy, but I think I took enough pictures that I can crap something out.
2015-02-05 16:39 <NegativeK> agocs: Really, really good chicken and biscuits. And a short order is $4.
2015-02-05 16:39 <agocs> Oh, so they do
2015-02-05 16:39 <Bioguy> I have some incredible fried chicken from Bavette's in the s. loop.
2015-02-05 16:39 <skay> CarlFK: pycon apac is in taipei at the end of may, but there is a big gap from when the sprint is (probably scheduled) and when pycon apac is https://tw.pycon.org/2015apac/en/
2015-02-05 16:39 <agocs> I did not notice that on their menu
2015-02-05 16:39 <Bioguy> had, not have
2015-02-05 16:39 <NegativeK> Android dev said they're the best food he's had in the loop.
2015-02-05 16:39 <skay> plus I don't know that much Chinese
2015-02-05 16:39 <agocs> I think I know what I'm getting
2015-02-05 16:40 <NegativeK> agocs: A heart attack in 14 years.
2015-02-05 16:40 <agocs> Given my sedentary lifestyle, it's possible
2015-02-05 16:41 <NegativeK> Eat enough frided chicken and buttery biscuits soaked in gravy and it moves to certainty.

2015-02-05 16:48 <agocs> Would installing cyanogenmod today be a mistake?
2015-02-05 16:49 <NegativeK> Depends on if you need your phone in the next eight hours.
2015-02-05 16:49 <bry> otherwise, I think it is wonderful
2015-02-05 16:49 <bry> One of my criteria for new phones
2015-02-05 16:49 <bry> is how well cyanogenmod installs on it
2015-02-05 16:51 <agocs> does it actually take 8 hours, or is 8 hours just a worst case?
2015-02-05 16:51 <NegativeK> I don't remember it taking eight hours.
2015-02-05 16:51 <NegativeK> And that was two-three years ago.
2015-02-05 16:51 <hef_> agocs: more depends on wether or not it works on the first try
2015-02-05 16:52 <NegativeK> But between something going whack and you wanting to configure everything, eight hours isn't totally unreasonable.
2015-02-05 16:52 <hef_> sometimes you have to learn what games you have to play to get through the bootloader issues
2015-02-05 16:52 <hef_> and the bootloader issues depends on make/model and carrier
2015-02-05 16:52 <skay> install it after work, not during work
2015-02-05 16:53 <skay> make sure you install android developer tools so you get fastboot and adb
2015-02-05 16:53 <skay> make sure your phone is rooted
2015-02-05 16:53 <skay> make sure you enable debug mode on your phone by using the easter egg
2015-02-05 16:53 <agocs> > install it after work, not during work
2015-02-05 16:53 <agocs> killjoy
2015-02-05 16:53 <skay> install the clockwork thingee bootloader thingee? so when you power up in that mode you have a very nice menu thingee
2015-02-05 16:53 <skay> ha

2015-02-05 16:54 <hef_> last time I tried clockwork, it didn't support encryption
2015-02-05 16:54 <skay> so then next you get hte image you want for cyanogenmod. and then get the package thingee that has all the google apps so you can install them if youw ant them
2015-02-05 16:54 <skay> hef_: I can't remember honestly what I have but I think it is clockwork
2015-02-05 16:54 <hef_> most people use clockwork

2015-02-05 17:22 <agocs> bry: I have a few quick "can this person even code" questions
2015-02-05 17:22 <agocs> - Implement fibonacci 
2015-02-05 17:22 <NegativeK> - Fizz buzz
2015-02-05 17:22 <agocs> - Reverse all the vowels in a string
2015-02-05 17:23 <agocs> - Determine if a number is divisible by 3 based on the sum of the digits in the number
2015-02-05 17:23 <asl2> er, "reverse all vowels"?  by inserting unicode rtl markers?
2015-02-05 17:24 <agocs> asl2: Hello becomes Holle
2015-02-05 17:24 <NegativeK> Don't hire asl2; he's excessively clever.
2015-02-05 17:24 <asl2> ah, ok
2015-02-05 17:24 <bry> yeah, fizz buzz is def on there
2015-02-05 17:24 <agocs> You really only need one question like that
2015-02-05 17:24 <agocs> Too many and you're covering the same ground again and again
2015-02-05 17:24 <asl2> I was about to ask if I needed to do language id and figure out when y or w or l or r was functioning as a vowel
2015-02-05 17:26 <bry> I never super liked fibonacci. It feels a little contrived
2015-02-05 17:26 <agocs> bry: The nice thing about fibonacci is you can ask about runtime complexity
2015-02-05 17:26 <agocs> The naive recursive solution runs in O(n^2) time
2015-02-05 17:27 <agocs> if the interview candidate can discuss runtime complexity and what that means, they're probably a little bit smarter than the average idiot
2015-02-05 17:27 <hef> cheating works in O(1)
2015-02-05 17:27 <agocs> hef: big ol' lookup table?
2015-02-05 17:27 <NegativeK> I seem to remember that the recursive solution runs in O(fib(n)) (which is O(n^2), but is neat.)
2015-02-05 17:27 <hef> use the golden ration
2015-02-05 17:27 <hef> ratio
2015-02-05 17:27 <hef> and round correctly
2015-02-05 17:27 <asl2> hef: only if you measure complexity with fixed-size numbers
2015-02-05 17:27 <skay> bry: https://pinboard.in/u:sky/t:interviewing/
2015-02-05 17:28 <agocs> bry: If the interview candidate can identify the fastest iterative solution, even better
2015-02-05 17:28 <skay> bry: I cleaned up some tags for you. but anyway, I tend to collect articles that will inform me when I interview people or when I talk about the interviewing process because it's interesting from a psychological standpoint
2015-02-05 17:28 <Bioguy> My house is built around the golden ratio.  I was extremely picky about this.
2015-02-05 17:28 <hef> asl2: oh?
2015-02-05 17:28 <skay> bry: I started to get really curious about it because of wanting to hire people for orbitz
2015-02-05 17:29 <agocs> The only problem with fibonacci is that people have seen it before
2015-02-05 17:29 <sylphiae> NegativeK: agocs: `justin: heading out in 5
2015-02-05 17:29 <skay> bry: so, how does it all work? when you use different methods, are you selecting too narrow of a population? does it matter if you select a narrow population segment? etc
2015-02-05 17:29 <asl2> IIRC in my algorithms class we measured space complexity in terms of bit operations
2015-02-05 17:29 <sylphiae> KyleB: ^
2015-02-05 17:29 <hef> I'm going to assume that the question caps out at 64 bits
2015-02-05 17:29 <asl2> hef: ok, often a reasonable assumption
2015-02-05 17:30 <NegativeK> Heading out in a little more than five.
2015-02-05 17:30 <skay> bry: questions about data structures and algorithm complexity are bogus for experienced programmers, use those more on recent grads
2015-02-05 17:30 <KyleB> Likewise, about to head out
2015-02-05 17:30 <bry> the practical web dev stuff I think is a higher priority
2015-02-05 17:30 <bry> and is what I mostly do day to day
2015-02-05 17:30 <skay> bry: if someone pulls that shit on me, or pulls fizzbuzz on me, it annoys the hell out of me because it has nothing to do with a job
2015-02-05 17:31 <bry> hm

2015-02-05 17:31 <NegativeK> I've heard that take home programming tests will make valid candidates walk away.
2015-02-05 17:31 <NegativeK> Which wouldn't surprise me if they're interviewing in multiple places.
2015-02-05 17:31 <bry> skay: the biggest thing about my interview here that I liked
2015-02-05 17:31 <`justin> i suppose i should start walking over
2015-02-05 17:31 <skay> bry: I'd rather be asked some question about -- what approaches would you take to implement a backend webservice (give a specific example) that needs to meet <these requirements>
2015-02-05 17:31 <`justin> lunch!
2015-02-05 17:32 <asl2> I came in for a day to work at one place, and they paid me
2015-02-05 17:32 <NegativeK> asl2: Ohhh, my first real job did that.
2015-02-05 17:32 <agocs> skay: That's phase 2
2015-02-05 17:32 <bry> was a technical portion of the interview that was on the computer 
2015-02-05 17:32 <NegativeK> "I know you don't know QA, but QA this site. We're paying hourly."
2015-02-05 17:32 <skay> NegativeK: depends. I've seen people complain about those because some places make them sound shady, almost as though they are trying to get free work from people
2015-02-05 17:32 <bry> where we left the interviewee alone in the room
2015-02-05 17:32 <bry> and they had full internet access
2015-02-05 17:32 <hef> agocs: do they get bonus points for knowing the word memoization?
2015-02-05 17:32 <agocs> hef: yep
2015-02-05 17:33 <bry> skay: those are the kinds of questions that I want to emphasize
2015-02-05 17:33 <bry> personally, pulling out algorithm stuff is not the most useful
2015-02-05 17:33 <skay> agocs: MEH. if I'm looking for something I don't feel like jumping over lame-ass college grad hoops. my memory is so vague for that shit. I could talk about api disgin, if you wanted an api to do whatthing -- walk through it, give some off the cuff interface suggestions, discuss pros and cons
2015-02-05 17:34 <asl2> only awkward part was that it was for a food software place, we started talking about kosher food as part of the work we were doing, and they asked if I was Jewish.  (A job interview is the only time I'll evade that question, not because I'm worried about discrimination, but because it's forbidden.)
2015-02-05 17:34 <bry> I don't do memoization or runtime things
2015-02-05 17:34 <bry> day to day
2015-02-05 17:34 <agocs> I find that good programmers can, even if they don't from day to day
2015-02-05 17:35 <bry> I'd rather have the demonstrated ability to work through something
2015-02-05 17:35 <bry> knowing o of whatever is remembering that crap from college
2015-02-05 17:35 <agocs> You're designing the interview. bundle everything you want into it
2015-02-05 17:35 <skay> and also, I would not be hardass if I'm interviewing someone if I have a company that is not a big ecommerce site. e.g. I would be hardass about hiring a senior to lead position for orbitz. I expect a lot of knowledge about designing things that will scale and not fall over. but if it's for some small site, then no, expecting a candidate to pretend to be at amazon and know all that shit is unreasanble. if we end up needing, they can learn on the
2015-02-05 17:35 <skay>  job
2015-02-05 17:36 <skay> in fact, they could learn on the job regardless
2015-02-05 17:36 <skay> I don't like being a hardass
2015-02-05 17:36 <bry> agocs: fair. also giving my opinion on the sort of thing.
2015-02-05 17:38 <bry> also, I need to make sure I can answer the questions, haha
2015-02-05 17:39 <NegativeK> Annnnnd to the chicken and biscuits!

2015-02-05 17:56 <bry> hehehehe
2015-02-05 17:57 <hef> I do runtime/profiling constantly
2015-02-05 17:59 <bry> that's fair. My argument against it in interviews is because we don't super use it. My opinion is very context specific.
2015-02-05 17:59 <bry> I mean, we still need a very generic form of that.
2015-02-05 17:59 <hef> I'm also betting basic runtime analysis is something you do deal with
2015-02-05 17:59 <bry> but pulling out big O notation seems overkill
2015-02-05 17:59 <skay> bry: what level position are you hiring for? jr, sr?
2015-02-05 18:00 <bry> jr to mid
2015-02-05 18:00 <bry> equal to or less than my level of experience (roughly)
2015-02-05 18:00 <bry> I don't know if I would be mid
2015-02-05 18:01 <bry> but I'm the only one right now
2015-02-05 18:01 <bry> and everything hasn't exploded
2015-02-05 18:01 <skay> bry: I think being context specific is okay, and then also ask questions to guage their thinking so that you know if they'll be able to pick up things or need hand holding
2015-02-05 18:01 <bry> We had a question that was about the full stack "experience"
2015-02-05 18:02 <bry> but we could phrase it a whole lot better
2015-02-05 18:02 <skay> jr -- need handholding with 1 or 2 daily checks the first week, 1 or so the 2nd week, reasonably talking and checking progress after the 1st month
2015-02-05 18:02 <hef> also, Big O notation lies a lot
2015-02-05 18:02 <hef> like a whole lot
2015-02-05 18:02 <skay> recent grad -- more hand holding. make sure they don't get blocked for more than an hour the first week or so
2015-02-05 18:03 <bry> It also feels weird to hire when I can recognize all of the areas I myself need to improve
2015-02-05 18:03 <skay> introvert - give them reflection time for answering questions (I have NO CLUE how to interview introverts. I am damn lucky anyone ever hired me)
2015-02-05 18:03 <skay> bry: I hope it doesn't make you feel weird. I think it should happen to everyone that way.
2015-02-05 18:04 <skay> I can have tacit knowledge or even some explicit knowledge but I have to know even more to be able to explain things
2015-02-05 18:05 <skay> note, I am very opinionated on interpersonal thingees and selection bias. like, it seems to me that the hip trend in interviews selects against introverted personality types? maybe?
2015-02-05 18:05 <skay> but, I went and looked for research to see if that is a big deal or not. maybe all the introverts should be thrown under the bus becuase extrovert companies make more money (BWAHAHA oops)
2015-02-05 18:05 <bry> I'm going to have to guard myself against things like that.
2015-02-05 18:06 <bry> we had recently hired someone and then fired them
2015-02-05 18:06 <bry> they were the big talker type
2015-02-05 18:06 <skay> I only found a few inconclusive studies and then got lazy about searching the literature
2015-02-05 18:06 <bry> I'm hoping we can guard against that in the interview
2015-02-05 18:06 <bry> the dude wouldn't take my suggestions
2015-02-05 18:06 <skay> bry: watch out for people with imposter syndrome who downplay their skills
2015-02-05 18:06 <zirc> Door Unlocked
2015-02-05 18:06 <bry> yeah, I think that I deal with that personally
2015-02-05 18:07 <skay> lots of people do that, so in interviews they will probably be using language that is coded to emphasize how other people helped them, how they worked on a team that *d, etc.
2015-02-05 18:07 <bry> I feel like I deal with a lot of people that are the opposite
2015-02-05 18:07 <bry> It's just rude to assume you did something yourself, haha
2015-02-05 18:07 <skay> that happens when I go to user groups and interact with people. it's amazing how opinionated people are and how much confidence they have in their opinions
2015-02-05 18:07 <skay> yeah and also self centered
2015-02-05 18:08 <skay> omg so then when I have to go in to interview mode I feel like a raging asshole

2015-02-05 18:11 <skay> basically what I am saying is fuck the db let's go outside now while I am out of my flow
2015-02-05 18:12 <skay> unless you can get db unfucked in <5 minutes
2015-02-05 18:12 <skay> you are already interrupted right, so we should just go
2015-02-05 18:12 <skay> is the db feeding you lunch? no
2015-02-05 18:12 <skay> it is also not the sun
2015-02-05 18:13 <t_j> i think skay is hungry
2015-02-05 18:13 <skay> CarlFK: is the db married to someone who is hungry (thanks t_j) and or light deprived who may fall in to a morasse of despair and not want to leave the house?
2015-02-05 18:13 <asl2> oracle (nee sun) makes mysql and oracle - is it either of those dbs?
2015-02-05 18:14 <skay> asl2: postgresql, I am saved
2015-02-05 18:14 <skay> omg it has been at least 5 minutes. CarlFK, why do you hate puppies? I am going to start killing puppies now
2015-02-05 18:15 <loans> new workplace is near many more lunch options than old
2015-02-05 18:15 <loans> including puerogis
2015-02-05 18:15 <skay> maybe I should just leave and let CarlFK join me later
2015-02-05 18:15 <skay> loans: yum
2015-02-05 18:15 <loans> pierogi
2015-02-05 18:15 <skay> CarlFK usually yells at me when I suggest that option

2015-02-05 18:41 <loans> thatd be a good test
2015-02-05 18:42 <Toba> what's the interface to the rfid readers?
2015-02-05 18:42 <Toba> serial ascii? something else?
2015-02-05 18:42 <loans> ultimately theyll be serial
2015-02-05 18:43 <Toba> how do they talk to the beagle now
2015-02-05 18:43 <loans> usb atm because i am lazy
2015-02-05 18:43 <Toba> how many pins, what proto?
2015-02-05 18:43 <Toba> oh, they're usb
2015-02-05 18:43 <Toba> got it
2015-02-05 18:43 <Toba> so it acts like an HID device
2015-02-05 18:43 <loans> gonna plug them into a tty
2015-02-05 18:43 <loans> no
2015-02-05 18:43 <loans> its serial
2015-02-05 18:43 <Toba> that's how barcode scanners work
2015-02-05 18:43 <Toba> interesting
2015-02-05 18:43 <loans> usb tty
2015-02-05 18:43 <Toba> oh
2015-02-05 18:43 <Toba> so instead of reading the serial shit, you're using an FDTI
2015-02-05 18:43 <Toba> *FTDI
2015-02-05 18:43 <NegativeK> JFDI FTDI
2015-02-05 18:43 <loans> or something similar
2015-02-05 18:44 <loans> anyway, the board would have screw terminals for reader, transistor buffers and a relay
2015-02-05 18:44 <loans> or two
2015-02-05 18:45 <loans> header pins to plug right into beaglebonr

2015-02-05 19:14 <NegativeK> I've heard of people using git for their local version control and then using SVN/whatever because they have to.
2015-02-05 19:14 <NegativeK> Is that possible to avoid TFS warts?

2015-02-05 19:15 <`justin> this is me trying to recover from something that i fucked up this morning
2015-02-05 19:16 <NegativeK> Ahh.
2015-02-05 19:16 <`justin> of course when i was demonstrating how to do a thing in tfs this morning
2015-02-05 19:16 <`justin> it did this stupid thing it likes to do
2015-02-05 19:16 <`justin> where if i commit something from a totally unrelated project (the demo project i was showing this morning) it decides that I also want to commit this other stuff i was working on this morning in the same commit
2015-02-05 19:17 <`justin> so i basically committed incomplete code on a real project while trying to demonstrate how to use tfs on a demo project
2015-02-05 19:17 <`justin> :-(
2015-02-05 19:17 <`justin> and now i'm trying to revert that commit
2015-02-05 19:17 <`justin> without losing the work i did that accidentally got committed...

2015-02-05 22:04 <agocs> todd would enjoy that
2015-02-05 22:04 <CarlFK> NegativeK: I don't think 30 will be fast enough to get a good throw 
2015-02-05 22:05 <Toba> i hate it when someone attaches to some program.
2015-02-05 22:05 <Toba> it's the worst.
2015-02-05 22:05 <NegativeK> I'll give it a QA approved stamp if it poops snow bricks.
2015-02-05 22:05 <NegativeK> CarlFK: Prove it!
2015-02-05 22:05 <kuroishi> hah
2015-02-05 22:06 <CarlFK> hmm, something that compacts the snow into something stackable..   if fucking ingenious 
2015-02-05 22:06 <CarlFK> cuz some company is selling a diesel powered snow melting machines 
2015-02-05 22:06 <CarlFK> that costs $600/hour in fuel 
2015-02-05 22:06 <kuroishi> water is less fort-able than snow blocks.

2015-02-05 22:07 <kuroishi> CarlFK: we can make one
2015-02-05 22:07 <NegativeK> CarlFK's going to drive a combine up and down the street and see what happens.
2015-02-05 22:07 <kuroishi> I'm pretty sure theres plans in one of those welding books

2015-02-05 22:11 <NegativeK> Just make a 18' diameter saw.
2015-02-05 22:11 <Toba> I guess back in the day they made most things to run the farm with, on the farm.
2015-02-05 22:11 <NegativeK> Leave it running in the wood shop. Most of your cutting needs!
2015-02-05 22:11 <NegativeK> Or maybe weld all the band saw blades that we have together for a giant throat band saw.
2015-02-05 22:12 <NegativeK> Variable teeth pitch; time your cuts.
2015-02-05 22:12 <Toba> hm. http://www.publicsurplus.com/
2015-02-05 22:12 <kuroishi> yeah lets just run a band around the perimiter of the shop, as well as gas and air lines
2015-02-05 22:12 <CarlFK> t_j: that was balzy of the guy to hang out with the camera while the train blasted all that snow onto him

2015-02-05 22:15 <t_j> i like the ammount of trees stuck in the snow

2015-02-05 22:19 <kuroishi> i wanna see it hit a deer
2015-02-05 22:20 <NegativeK> I hit a rabbit with a bush hog mower.
2015-02-05 22:20 <NegativeK> It went "wump". =(
2015-02-05 22:20 <t_j> did you then make pie?
2015-02-05 22:20 <asl2> if you hit a wumpus what happens?
2015-02-05 22:20 <NegativeK> It goes "wabbit".
2015-02-05 22:20 <t_j> it goes wump wump wump
2015-02-05 22:20 <NegativeK> Then you're eaten.
2015-02-05 22:20 <`justin> why does it say "Do not hump"?
2015-02-05 22:20 <kuroishi> did you ever ride on the hump of a wump?
2015-02-05 22:21 <kuroishi> `justin: "humping" is when you drop a car off a string of cars down a hill
2015-02-05 22:21 <kuroishi> and it shuffles out into a "Bowl" - a series of switches leading to other strings of cars
2015-02-05 22:21 <kuroishi> it's how trains get split into different destinations sometimes
2015-02-05 22:21 <`justin> hmm
2015-02-05 22:21 <`justin> sounds like a job for Humping Station: One

2015-02-05 22:23 <Toba> hrm.
2015-02-05 22:24 <kuroishi> yes, "Non-retarded hump yards" are a thing
2015-02-05 22:24 <NegativeK> Magic.
2015-02-05 22:25 <kuroishi> so that's why it says "Do not hump" on a 3000hp snow blower car.  They don't want anyone dropping it down a hill and slamming it into a string of cars.
2015-02-05 22:25 <NegativeK> It can handle it.
2015-02-05 22:25 <NegativeK> Give it a shot.
2015-02-05 22:26 <NegativeK> Nobody'll mind.
2015-02-05 22:26 <NegativeK> What the fuck.

2015-02-05 22:48 <kuroishi> ah
2015-02-05 22:48 <kuroishi> I didn't realize exhaust stacks accumulate gypsum
2015-02-05 22:48 <NegativeK> " A by-product of desulfurization of flue gas from the stacks of fossil-fueled power plants, emissions captured from smoke stacks can be purified into a hard substance and manufactured into gypsum. Today, almost half of all gypsum used in the United States is FGD gypsum."

2015-02-05 22:56 <NegativeK> kuroishi: I kinda wanna build utter shit drift trikes.
2015-02-05 22:56 <kuroishi> NegativeK: their fun
2015-02-05 22:57 <NegativeK> Chicago Mini Maker Faire is a few months away.
2015-02-05 22:57 <kuroishi> the best is if you do casters, then bolt on mounts for 20" trailer wheels
2015-02-05 22:57 <CarlFK> NegativeK: what time?   I would be up for going over in the morning.  I kinda want to grab my ski boots
2015-02-05 22:57 <kuroishi> so you can ride it like a big wheel and not spin in circles when you want
2015-02-05 22:57 <kuroishi> NegativeK: those would be fun for the mini maker faire
2015-02-05 22:57 <NegativeK> They'd have to be not-terrifying-welds if we let other people on them. >.>

2015-02-05 22:58 <bjonnh> are you a kind of welding perfectionist?
2015-02-05 22:58 <kuroishi> me? no
2015-02-05 22:58 <kuroishi> the opposite
2015-02-05 22:59 <NegativeK> I'm more concerned about lopped-off kickstand pieces sticking out at ankle-level.
2015-02-05 22:59 <Toba> ha
2015-02-05 22:59 <kuroishi> I try to discourage welding perfection and focus on people building things that will break their welds so they can learn to make stronger ones.
2015-02-05 22:59 <NegativeK> God, don't ever watch me weld.
2015-02-05 22:59 <sylphiae> NegativeK: finally got a parachute reservation for the 21st at 5 PM, sat

2015-02-05 23:01 <NegativeK> CarlFK: I have no bike; I'm just needing a spot to stash one if I shit-weld one together with kuroishi.
2015-02-05 23:01 <NegativeK> kuroishi: I have cash to fund further scrapper purchases. :)

2015-02-06 04:20 <`justin> they should obviously call it Leatherworking Office Hours (LOO)

2015-02-06 16:18 <t_j> i dont think these messages are appropriate
2015-02-06 16:20 <Toba> t_j hates transparency!
2015-02-06 16:20 <Toba> (jk)
2015-02-06 16:20 <Toba> (mostly)
2015-02-06 16:20 <t_j> Toba: the failed payment ones mostly
2015-02-06 16:21 <Toba> I guess it's embarrassing to have the irc channel know you fucked up or are broke
2015-02-06 16:21 <`justin> t_j: i don't think hef currently has any filter on what messages are shown
2015-02-06 16:21 <Toba> clearly.
2015-02-06 16:21 <`justin> i believe he intends to have a lot fewer of them show up here once he understands what messages get sent a bit better
2015-02-06 16:21 <`justin> so you're probably right about certain ones being inappropriate
2015-02-06 16:22 <`justin> it would be good to make a list of which ones we think are good which ones we think are bad
2015-02-06 16:22 <`justin> ACTION is not volunteering to maintain tha tlist
2015-02-06 16:22 <`Nerobro> Announcing money things to the channel for personal money issues.. 
2015-02-06 16:22 <`Nerobro> is definitely not something that should be done.
2015-02-06 16:22 <hef> I should probably add the actual qualifier
2015-02-06 16:23 <hef> most max failed payment are usually your credit card on file with paypal expired
2015-02-06 16:23 <`Nerobro> Still has a potential to make someone look bad.
2015-02-06 16:23 <loans> those go to rt
2015-02-06 16:23 <t_j> hef: doesnt really matter, hey should be be in here
2015-02-06 16:23 <t_j> *they
2015-02-06 16:24 <t_j> not everyone looks at rt
2015-02-06 16:24 <hef> `justin: I had removed the individual payments because they were too noisy
2015-02-06 16:24 <hef> but I really didn't have plans to further filter messages
2015-02-06 16:24 <hef> `Nerobro: suggestions?
2015-02-06 16:24 <hef> The existing message is misleading
2015-02-06 16:25 <t_j> i'm not sure any messages about membership status are appropriate in here TBH
2015-02-06 16:25 <`Nerobro> it's something that shouldn't be done in channel.  Unless i'm missing some sort of utility.
2015-02-06 16:25 <`Nerobro> This isn't a management channel.
2015-02-06 16:25 <hef> General anyone looking at paypal know that "payment suspended" doesn't mean anything other than there was some glitch processing payment that was on paypal's end and we can't fix it
2015-02-06 16:25 <`Nerobro> knowing payments and such, is definitely something board members hsould get.
2015-02-06 16:26 <t_j> `Nerobro: and we get that via rt
2015-02-06 16:26 <`Nerobro> So that should definitely not happen here.
2015-02-06 16:27 <hef> hmm, I suppose I was using it for development
2015-02-06 16:27 <hef> (I needed to map out what those messages meant)
2015-02-06 16:27 <hef> that is how I disocered the "End of Term" messages
2015-02-06 16:27 <Toba> a bot testing channel is normally how i do that
2015-02-06 16:27 <hef> It's not something I can trigger manually
2015-02-06 16:28 <Toba> yeah, true
2015-02-06 16:28 <Toba> paypal has sandbox shit
2015-02-06 16:28 <Toba> but it suckz
2015-02-06 16:28 <`Nerobro> hef, a "#pumpingstationone-messages" channel isn't an inapropreate idea.
2015-02-06 16:28 <hef> It's insufficient for recuring payemnts
2015-02-06 16:28 <Toba> yeah
2015-02-06 16:29 <hef> `Nerobro: I'd like to keep the signup and EOT messages
2015-02-06 16:29 <t_j> hef: they serve no use
2015-02-06 16:29 <hef> I might change the "payment suspended" to "there was an error processing membership dues"
2015-02-06 16:29 <hef> or just remove it completely
2015-02-06 16:29 <`Nerobro> Signup, I can see benifits from.  EOT leads to embarassment.
2015-02-06 16:30 <hef> EOT is just end of term
2015-02-06 16:30 <t_j> meaning they cancelled?
2015-02-06 16:30 <`Nerobro> "you" know what it means.  But that's a message that should be sent directly to someone, not to the general group.
2015-02-06 16:30 <hef> Doesn't specif if it was cancelled manually paypal bailed on trying
2015-02-06 16:31 <hef> Ah,we may be at odds
2015-02-06 16:31 <`Nerobro> What good does it do to do that publicly?
2015-02-06 16:31 <hef> I'd like the information on who is and is not a member to be available
2015-02-06 16:31 <t_j> so now we all know that sylphiae has some financial issue that may or may not extend beyon bad data in paypal
2015-02-06 16:31 <t_j> thats inappropriate to show here
2015-02-06 16:31 <Toba> or she changed to full member to be on the board

2015-02-06 16:32 <Toba> HOW EMBARRASSING FOR HER
2015-02-06 16:32 <`Nerobro> "cancelations" should be public, but should be done after filtering for "did you mean to do that?"
2015-02-06 16:32 <t_j> who on the board uses these messages in irc? No one, we use rt, so why bother with the noise?

2015-02-06 16:36 <hef> (because you upgraded a month ago)
2015-02-06 16:37 <hef> There seems to be interest in not reporting when people leave the org
2015-02-06 16:37 <hef> I don't quite follow the rationale
2015-02-06 16:37 <`Nerobro> hef, I think that "should" be reported.  It shouldn't be reported here, or using something tied to paypal.
2015-02-06 16:37 <t_j> hef: because reasons for leaving may be personal and people may not want that announced on a megaphone

2015-02-06 16:40 <`Nerobro> NegativeK, I agree.  I think doing it on IRC in an automated fashion is.. not tactful.
2015-02-06 16:40 <loans> leaving the org is definitely not "private"
2015-02-06 16:40 <NegativeK> And I feel like the entire issue is a wrapper around "I dislike bot chatter."

2015-02-06 17:14 <Toba> supposedly it already does
2015-02-06 17:14 <Toba> but also supposedly it doesn't
2015-02-06 17:14 <Toba> so
2015-02-06 17:14 <Toba> uhhhh
2015-02-06 17:14 <NegativeK> Oh, does the members site require SSL for resource access polling?
2015-02-06 17:15 <hef> So far yes
2015-02-06 17:15 <NegativeK> Ah.
2015-02-06 17:15 <hef> I was going to suggest that we could do a Curve25519
2015-02-06 17:15 <NegativeK> Do a?
2015-02-06 17:15 <hef> err do a Curve24419 endpoint
2015-02-06 17:15 <NegativeK> Implement the shit client side?
2015-02-06 17:15 <NegativeK> Oh, nope. Lost more.
2015-02-06 17:15 <hef> ok, backin up
2015-02-06 17:16 <hef> so curve25519 is a newish crypto algorithm
2015-02-06 17:16 <NegativeK> Good thing to do when lost.
2015-02-06 17:16 <hef> but I think it would be straight forward to use on an arduino like

2015-02-06 17:17 <hef> because doing https/ssl on an arduino like if someone hasn't done it already sounds terrible
2015-02-06 17:17 <NegativeK> Ah.
2015-02-06 17:17 <NegativeK> So, embedded device uses Curve25519 to talk to a middle-man that does the proper members site resource check?
2015-02-06 17:18 <hef> effecively
2015-02-06 17:18 <NegativeK> Intriguing.
2015-02-06 17:18 <NegativeK> Is the SSL requirement on the resource check to prevent people from faking the members site?
2015-02-06 17:18 <hef> but if https is already available for the esp8266, there isn't much of a point
2015-02-06 17:18 <NegativeK> Word.
2015-02-06 17:19 <hef> yes
2015-02-06 17:19 <NegativeK> Man.
2015-02-06 17:19 <hef> also helps ensure rfid tags are not transmitted in cleartext, but that may be moot
2015-02-06 17:19 <NegativeK> I consider most security around the access control to be pretty moot.
2015-02-06 17:19 <hef> I just don't want the failings to be my failings (;
2015-02-06 17:20 <NegativeK> It just forces people to be explicitly malicious to get around, instead of "Oh, it was just a quick cut."
2015-02-06 17:20 <NegativeK> Heh, word.
2015-02-06 17:20 <hef> You know how there are armchair lawyers?

2015-02-06 17:21 <Toba> but is it bitcoin?
2015-02-06 17:21 <NegativeK> Ed pointed out that you can bypass any tool access control by shorting relay pins with a screwdriver. ;)
2015-02-06 17:21 <hef> and then point out they are asking the wrong question
2015-02-06 17:21 <CarlFK> we need access control to the access control to the access control...
2015-02-06 17:21 <hef> like "Can I short the relay with a screwdriver"
2015-02-06 17:21 <NegativeK> Just hire a shop bouncer to punch people for every five minutes of tool use.
2015-02-06 17:22 <NegativeK> Regardless of auth.
2015-02-06 17:22 <NegativeK> I think I'll aim at tool monitoring, and then dumb HTTP requests to a text file as a PoC.

2015-02-06 17:33 <Toba> with topics
2015-02-06 17:34 <Toba> so, to do that
2015-02-06 17:34 <t_j> why not just use a real broker at that point?
2015-02-06 17:34 <Toba> I would like to make the broker do both, 1 port for each

2015-02-06 17:35 <Toba> eg, microcontrollers aren't going to be able to deal with full on amqp
2015-02-06 17:35 <Toba> I figured making one thing that takes in all of it
2015-02-06 17:35 <Toba> I'd have to write a daemon eventually
2015-02-06 17:35 <t_j> yeah, mqtt seems best for micros
2015-02-06 17:35 <Toba> so may as well start that way
2015-02-06 17:36 <Toba> does mqtt work typically as a library to take it in, or a broker daemon?

2015-02-06 17:36 <`justin> they can't seem to get my phone number right
2015-02-06 17:36 <Toba> I think that's a misnomer
2015-02-06 17:36 <CarlFK> why the $#@! won't this just display in my browser? http://www.google.com/a/cpanel/chicagoacm.org/images/logo.gif
2015-02-06 17:36 <t_j> Toba: nope, i understand the multi proto aspect
2015-02-06 17:36 <Toba> ok
2015-02-06 17:37 <t_j> Toba: I was thinking that we could morph broker into a udp/zmq bridge into a real broker 
2015-02-06 17:37 <hef> zmq wants to kill multipart in the long run
2015-02-06 17:37 <Toba> hef - didn't know that
2015-02-06 17:37 <`justin> ACTION doesn't know if his computer will ever get fixed :-(
2015-02-06 17:37 <Toba> t_j: we sure could, I suppose. One of the benefits of doing this with the zmq lib and python only, is that you can get the whole thing up and going without having to fuck around with an mq daemon install on your system.
2015-02-06 17:38 <NegativeK> `justin: Maybe you could demand a replacement since they're fucking around so long?
2015-02-06 17:38 <Toba> but if you see benefits in combining it, then let's.
2015-02-06 17:38 <`justin> "yeah, I'm tired of waiting for you people to get your shit together. Could you just send me a new laptop?"
2015-02-06 17:38 <`justin> "I'll be sure to check with my neighbors when they recieve it."
2015-02-06 17:39 <NegativeK> If you have some level of crazy Lenovo support..
2015-02-06 17:39 <NegativeK> Oh. >.>
2015-02-06 17:39 <`justin> :-P
2015-02-06 17:39 <`justin> i have the on-site warranty
2015-02-06 17:39 <t_j> Toba: I can have a play :)  current status = waiting on ops for packages to get installed
2015-02-06 17:39 <Toba> t_j: play forth.
2015-02-06 17:39 <`justin> basically a no questions asked kind of warranty
2015-02-06 17:39 <`justin> other than "what's wrong with it" :-)
2015-02-06 17:39 <Toba> t_j: having mqtt work with this would be nice.
2015-02-06 17:39 <t_j> Toba: I already have  a broker running in my dev env here so I can just attach to that
2015-02-06 17:39 <NegativeK> `justin: Sounds like they should maybe be asking a few more questions.
2015-02-06 17:40 <Toba> t_j: it would be better than my no guarantee of delivery udp stuff, probably.
2015-02-06 17:40 <NegativeK> Like "What's your phone number for reals?"
2015-02-06 17:40 <`justin> lol
2015-02-06 17:40 <`justin> that's the question i keep asking them
2015-02-06 17:40 <`justin> "what's my phone number? no, that's wrong!"
2015-02-06 17:40 <NegativeK> Jeez.
2015-02-06 17:40 <`justin> well
2015-02-06 17:40 <`justin> if i don't hear from the tech in the next 2 hours or so
2015-02-06 17:40 <`justin> i'll just call back
2015-02-06 17:41 <`justin> and be like
2015-02-06 17:41 <`justin> "can i just check if you have my correct phone number?"
2015-02-06 17:41 <NegativeK> "Heeeeyyyyy".
2015-02-06 17:41 <t_j> NegativeK: is the udp stuff bi-dir?
2015-02-06 17:41 <NegativeK> ACTION suspects a mis-tab expansion.
2015-02-06 17:41 <Toba> t_j: not yet, no
2015-02-06 17:42 <Toba> the udp stuff only goes from the esp to the broker, not the other way
2015-02-06 17:42 <Toba> I had ideas about extending it to go the other way, but at that point I think mqtt might make a lot more sense.
2015-02-06 17:42 <`justin> ACTION should try to do some real work today... <.<
2015-02-06 17:42 <Toba> ...
2015-02-06 17:42 <Toba> oh shit
2015-02-06 17:42 <Toba> same
2015-02-06 17:42 <Toba> I supposedly went to do real work 30 minutes ago
2015-02-06 17:42 <`justin> yeah
2015-02-06 17:42 <`justin> me too...
2015-02-06 17:42 <`justin> ok
2015-02-06 17:42 <`justin> later irc
2015-02-06 17:43 <Toba> t_j: pls post further updates in #thingsbus if you have other stuff, otherwise i will miss them due to back chat.
2015-02-06 17:43 <Toba> (probably)
2015-02-06 17:43 <Toba> I am excited to see what happens if you have an esp8266 listening to a Thing namespace over mqtt and have it do stuff, that would be rad.
2015-02-06 17:44 <NegativeK> It's nice not having to think about timezones when scheduling things.
2015-02-06 17:46 <Toba> iso 8601 bitches.
2015-02-06 17:48 <NegativeK> 'Instead "values in the range [0000] through [1582] shall only be used by mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange."'
2015-02-06 17:48 <NegativeK> lol dates
2015-02-06 17:50 <Toba> inb4 the proleptic julian calendar
2015-02-06 17:51 <Toba> jk, gregorian
2015-02-06 17:51 <Toba> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar is a fun read
2015-02-06 17:51 <Toba> The proleptic Gregorian calendar is explicitly required for all dates before 1582 by ISO 8601:2004 (clause 4.3.2.1 The Gregorian calendar) if the partners to information exchange agree.
2015-02-06 17:52 <Toba> dates and times are funny shit.
2015-02-06 17:52 <Toba> If you think untempered horror is funny.
2015-02-06 17:53 <NegativeK> I have a shitty solution that will anger everyone!
2015-02-06 17:53 <NegativeK> Use timezones for temporally local references to old shit.
2015-02-06 17:54 <NegativeK> GUTC.
2015-02-06 17:54 <t_j> Toba: broker does not run
2015-02-06 17:54 <t_j>     from thingsbus import thing
2015-02-06 17:54 <t_j> fails 
2015-02-06 17:54 <Toba> what wd are you in
2015-02-06 17:54 <Toba> did you create a python virtualenv
2015-02-06 17:54 <Toba> did you do pip install -r requirements.txt
2015-02-06 17:55 <t_j> fuck virtualenv
2015-02-06 17:55 <Toba> uh
2015-02-06 17:55 <Toba> why?
2015-02-06 17:55 <Toba> it works pretty well....
2015-02-06 17:55 <Toba> that's how every python programmer I know works with libraries
2015-02-06 17:55 <NegativeK> Panty hates virtualenvs.
2015-02-06 17:55 <t_j> yeah, doesnt work for me, dont like seperate copys of libs makes it hard to package
2015-02-06 17:55 <t_j> and deploy
2015-02-06 17:55 <NegativeK> But it's hard to separate blather from valid issues.
2015-02-06 17:56 <NegativeK> s/seperate/seperate his/
2015-02-06 17:56 <Toba> then install the dpes that I list in my requirements.txt globally
2015-02-06 17:56 <t_j> Toba: at $work all systems are deployed through the system package manager, no rvm/virtualenv/perl equiv
2015-02-06 17:56 <Toba> congrats I guess?
2015-02-06 17:57 <t_j> Toba: I come from an ops background, its more controlled this way than with 100s of virtualenvs hanging arround that need auditing
2015-02-06 17:57 <t_j> anyway I digress
2015-02-06 17:57 <Toba> I like virtualenv and intend to keep using it... you can get the same libs elsewhere if you want

2015-02-06 18:03 <NegativeK> ..
2015-02-06 18:03 <`justin> he said something like Clinith

2015-02-06 18:04 <`justin> he was really unsure of where that would be

2015-02-06 18:56 <kuroishi> critical mass chicago bike winter art show opening tonight
2015-02-06 18:57 <sylphiae> neat
2015-02-06 18:57 <kuroishi> http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150205/logan-square/bike-winter-art-show-critical-mass-collide-on-months-last-friday-photos
2015-02-06 18:57 <kuroishi> 2525 N. Elston Ave
2015-02-06 18:57 <t_j>   at least they wont be breaking the laws and being reckless
2015-02-06 18:58 <kuroishi> Rat Patrol, a bike club in Chicago that makes bikes from salvaged items, will be showcasing a bike made from a bed frame, as well as an an interactive stationary bike that crushes empty beer cans.
2015-02-06 18:58 <kuroishi> Revolution Brewery has donated cases of canned beer, so crushing the cans on the bike "should be fun," Lane said.
2015-02-06 18:58 <`justin> neat
2015-02-06 18:59 <kuroishi> t_j: it's hard to be reckless in a group of 2000 people going < 5pmh
2015-02-06 18:59 <kuroishi> it's also hard to go anywhere quickly and not completely gridlock the loop without going through lights.
2015-02-06 18:59 <t_j> running stop signs/lights is reckless and they do it
2015-02-06 19:00 <kuroishi> police wave us throught lights to keep the traffic disruption moving.
2015-02-06 19:00 <`justin> meh
2015-02-06 19:00 <t_j> kuroishi: not in my experiance outside the loop
2015-02-06 19:00 <`justin> at critical mass, the whole mass of bikers is a single vehicle in my mind
2015-02-06 19:00 <`justin> it's dangerous to do otherwise
2015-02-06 19:00 <kuroishi> ^
2015-02-06 19:00 <`justin> because cars will try to squeeze through gaps in the mass
2015-02-06 19:01 <kuroishi> and would also be more disruptive.
2015-02-06 19:01 <kuroishi> to things in general
2015-02-06 19:01 <t_j> the car has as much right to be in the gap as a bike does
2015-02-06 19:01 <`justin> uhh
2015-02-06 19:01 <`justin> what?
2015-02-06 19:01 <`justin> i don't think you're understanding t_j 
2015-02-06 19:02 <kuroishi> anyway, this art show isn't about critical mass or supporting them in any way
2015-02-06 19:02 <hef> Toba: http://hintjens.com/blog:84
2015-02-06 19:02 <kuroishi> it's about making bike art and riding bikes in the winter.
2015-02-06 19:04 <`justin> haha
2015-02-06 19:04 <`justin> that bed frame bike is awesome
2015-02-06 19:04 <`justin> add a tow line to pull the grill behind it :-)
2015-02-06 19:04 <kuroishi> `justin: cris, who comes and has me drill stuff for him in cold metals sometimes built that
2015-02-06 19:04 <`justin> yeah, i think i might have met him once
2015-02-06 19:04 <kuroishi> probably
2015-02-06 19:04 <`justin> it has his picture in that article as well
2015-02-06 19:05 <kuroishi> oh yeah
2015-02-06 19:06 <kuroishi> `justin: you doing CM tonight?

2015-02-06 19:18 <`justin> that was last week
2015-02-06 19:18 <kuroishi> damnit
2015-02-06 19:18 <`justin> i'm pretty sure nackle even went to it

2015-02-06 19:18 <kuroishi> they ride to the closing
2015-02-06 19:19 <kuroishi> not the opening
2015-02-06 19:19 <`justin> yeah

2015-02-10 02:23 <kuroishi> that was pretty clever.

2015-02-10 02:27 <kuroishi> hmmm.... Who could possibly be controlling zirc ?
2015-02-10 02:27 <Toba> i wonder
2015-02-10 02:27 <Toba> what a mystery
2015-02-10 02:27 <kuroishi> not Toba.
2015-02-10 02:27 <Toba> certainly not.
2015-02-10 02:27 <hef> I actually don't know how you got zirc to send ACTION instead of privmsg
2015-02-10 02:27 <kuroishi> Toba: were you using dockerbot?

2015-02-10 02:30 <zirc> weurd
2015-02-10 02:30 <hef> that shouldn't work
2015-02-10 02:30 <hef> why does that?
2015-02-10 02:30 <zirc> ACTION it works like this hef
2015-02-10 02:30 <Toba> >>> socket.send(chr(1) + 'ACTION it works like this hef' + chr(1))
2015-02-10 02:31 <Toba> its really quite easy
2015-02-10 02:31 <Toba> its not actually a different message type
2015-02-10 02:31 <Toba> its just formatted with weird shit
2015-02-10 02:31 -!- tac_(~tac-tics@99-126-152-116.lightspeed.cicril.sbcglobal.net) has joined #pumpingstationone
2015-02-10 02:31 <Toba> and the client renders it differently
2015-02-10 02:31 <kuroishi> hah neat
2015-02-10 02:31 <zirc> 4,9colors are also neat
2015-02-10 02:31 <Toba> >>> socket.send(chr(3) + '4,9colors are also neat' + chr(3))
2015-02-10 02:32 <Toba> in related news now my head hurts
2015-02-10 02:32 <Toba> and i have only myself to blame
2015-02-10 02:32 <kuroishi> from colors and rfcs?
2015-02-10 02:32 <hef> ACTION is different than privmsg though
2015-02-10 02:32 <kuroishi> =P
2015-02-10 02:32 <Toba> hef no it is not
2015-02-10 02:32 <Toba> it is treated differently in some event handling for irc scripting
2015-02-10 02:32 <Toba> and some irc frameworks translate it for you
2015-02-10 02:33 <Toba> but the wire proto uses PRIVMSG #pumpingstationone :\x01ACTIOn whatever\x01
2015-02-10 02:33 <Toba> it always has
2015-02-10 02:33 <Toba> maybe there is a new type in a later irc fc
2015-02-10 02:33 <Toba> *rfc
2015-02-10 02:33 <Toba> to treat it differently
2015-02-10 02:33 <Toba> but the old way is the control codes and no irc stuff will stop supporting it ever, probably
2015-02-10 02:33 <Toba> all CTCP is really just privmsg with \x01CTCP_COMMAND args\x01
2015-02-10 02:33 <Toba> in it

2015-02-10 02:48 <kuroishi> tac_: fuck yeah
2015-02-10 02:48 <tac_> I waited an hour to eat you 
2015-02-10 02:48 <kuroishi> best pizza in the world right there
2015-02-10 02:48 <tac_> I took you on the train with me, bro
2015-02-10 02:48 <tac_> WHY?
2015-02-10 02:48 <kuroishi> tac_: it was still worth it right?
2015-02-10 02:48 <kuroishi> you'd do it again tomorrow, and in fact, probably will?
2015-02-10 02:49 <tac_> YOU BET YOUR GODDAMN JOB IT WAS WORTH IT
2015-02-10 02:49 <tac_> kuroishi: I don't believe in free will. So probability will is the best we can do
2015-02-10 02:49 <tac_> (It's not a philosophical thing. It's a liability concern)
2015-02-10 02:50 <kuroishi> I lol'd.
2015-02-10 02:51 <tac_> Actually kuroishi 
2015-02-10 02:51 <tac_> I only finished half
2015-02-10 02:51 <tac_> so...
2015-02-10 02:52 <tac_> Sorry tomorrow me
2015-02-10 03:07 <kuroishi> I knew that.
2015-02-10 03:07 <kuroishi> I've been stuck in that delicious delicious stuffed trap.
2015-02-10 03:07 <kuroishi> and will be again.
2015-02-10 03:10 <loans> !open
2015-02-10 03:11 <loans> i don't think i've had loumalnatis
2015-02-10 03:11 <loans> i should fix that
2015-02-10 03:11 <kuroishi> yeah
2015-02-10 03:12 <kuroishi> I usually order art of pizza cause it's closer and maybe cheaper I think, but malnati's is way better.
2015-02-10 03:12 <kuroishi> my buddy who worked with me at the webhosting company had an aunt that managed a location
2015-02-10 03:12 <kuroishi> and he got our shift pizza all the time

2015-02-10 03:12 <kuroishi> we lived on it
2015-02-10 03:12 <tac_> Information theory is good shit, apparently
2015-02-10 03:13 <loans> deep fried cheese is a good thing
2015-02-10 03:13 <kuroishi> always
2015-02-10 03:13 <kuroishi> Smallbar is nearby, good deep fried cheese.
2015-02-10 03:13 <kuroishi> I want flaming cheese, however.
2015-02-10 03:14 <kuroishi> I haven't had that in years
